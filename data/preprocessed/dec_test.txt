1	Exploration can happen at various levels of granularity and at different times during an episode,  and this work performs a study of the problem of exploration (when to explore/when to switch between exploring and exploitation, at what time-scale to do so, and what signals would be good triggers to switch). The study is performed on atari games.  Strenghts: ------------ The study is well motivated and the manuscript is overall well written Studies a new problem area, and proposes an initial novel method for this problem extensive study on atari problems  Weaknesses -------------- some clarity issues as pointed out by the reviewers no illustrative task is given to give a more intuitive exposition of the "when to explore" problem comparison to some extra baselines like GoExplore would have been insightful  Rebuttal: ---------- Most clarity issues have been addressed satisfactorily. It has been explained why some requests for extra baselines would be challenging/or not relevant enough. While the authors agree that GoExplore would be an interesting baseline, they seem to have not added it. An illustrative task was not provided.  Summary: ------------ All reviewers agree that this manuscript opens up and tackles a novel direction in exploration, and provides an extensive empirical study on atari games (a standard benchmark for such problem settings). While I agree with the reviewers that point out that this paper could have been made stronger by adding an illustrative task and additional baselines like GoExplore, there is a general consensus that the provided empirical study on this novel problem setting is a good contribution in itself. Because of this I recommend accept.
1	This paper proposes a relatively complicated method for source-free unsupervised domain adaptation, which integrates several techniques into a divide and contrast framework. The idea of dividing the target data into source-like subset and target-specific subset and employing global alignment and feature consistency for each subset is novel when the source data is inaccessible. The contrastive learning and memory-based MMD are novel in the context of source-free domain adaptation and introduce theoretical benefits in terms of the expansion theory and domain alignment theory, respectively. Reviewers were on the positive side while holding some concerns on the marginal improvement over the SoTA methods, which were addressed in the author rebuttal. AC generally agreed that the paper has introduced a novel and solid contribution to the field, with a nice connection between algorithmic methods and theoretical insights, and  recommended the paper for acceptance. Authors are suggested to incorporate all rebuttal material in the revision and if possible, to work out a recipe for easing the adoption of their relatively complicated framework that comes with many modules and loss terms.
1	This paper explores the use of partial rejection control (PRC) for improved SMC-based variational bounds. While an unbiased SMC variant with PRC has been previously introduced by Kudlicka et al. (2020), this work introduces innovations that can help apply such ideas to variational inference. These bounds result in improvements in empirical performance.   This paper was heavily discussed, with significant engagement by both the authors and the reviewers. Most reviewers recommended acceptance of this paper, with one reviewer (R4) recommending against acceptance. R4's central concerns regard the novelty of the proposed approach and its positioning relative to the existing SMC literature. The authors argued vigorously in the comments that this paper should be judged as a contribution to the VI literature and not the SMC literature.  Unfortunately, I will recommend that this paper is rejected. It is my opinion that R4's concerns were not fully addressed.  On the one hand, I agree with the authors that there is significant value to be had in exploring variants of SMC for VI. Indeed, some prior art, like FIVO and IWAE, contributed little to the Monte Carlo literature. I believe that these were good contributions.  On the other hand, I am concerned that the current draft does not clearly circumscribe its contributions. I read the sections that disuss the works of Schmon et al. (2019) and Kudlicka et al. (2020), and the writing did not leave me with a clear enough sense of the differences. I also read the abstract and introduction of the paper. The introduction of the paper positions this work clearly within the VI literature, but does not clearly discuss prior SMC art, e.g., it does not cite Kudlicka et al. (2020). Despite citing rejection control for SMC, the writing of the abstract and introduction left me with the impression that this work was the first to introduce *unbiased, partial* rejection control for SMC. I believe that impressions matter and that the machine learning community should be generous to adjacent communities when assigning credit.  I realize that my decision is a matter of taste. I also want to say that I am confident that the authors have a clear sense of where their contribution sits, and I suspect that it is a valuable contribution. However, I cannot recommend the draft in its current form. If this is a contribution to the VI literature, as the authors argue, then the authors should not hesitate to give full credit to prior SMC art. My reading of the current draft still leaves me confused about which aspects of the SMC estimator are actual contributions.
1	All the reviewers appreciate the value of the proposed benchmarks. The remaining concerns seem addressable. I recommend accepting the paper while asking the authors to incorporate the review feedback into the camera-ready paper.
1	I thank the authors for their submission and active participation in the discussions. This papers is borderline. On the positive side, reviewers emphasized this is a well written [ovqB,1zPe] and sound paper [BUDa] with good theoretical [td5N,ovqB,1zPe] and empirical [BUDa,td5N,ovqB] results. On the negative side, reviewers remarked clarity [KyZj,AVki], incremental with respect to Tasse et al (2020) [KyZj], relatively restricted Boolean task algebra [td5N], toyish nature of the environments considered [ovqB], and some missing details [1zPe]. During discussion, the sentiment seems to be somewhat lukewarm with none of the reviewers strongly favoring acceptance or rejection. It seems the main remaining concern is around the toyish nature of the environments used in this paper. I acknowledge that and I believe the authors could include experiments on more complex environments. However, I also give the authors credit for addressing most of the reviewer's concerns during rebuttal and for presenting a solid empirical and theoretical result that the research community can build upon in the future. I am therefore recommending acceptance of this paper and highly encourage the authors to further improve their paper based on the reviewer feedback.
0	This paper has been reviewed by four experts. Their independent evaluations were consistent, all recommended rejection. I agree with that assessment as this paper is not ready for publication at ICLR in its current form. The reviewers have provided the authors with ample constructive feedback and the authors have been encouraged to consider this feedback if they choose to continue the work on this topic.
1	This work provides an analysis explaining why FedAvg can produce more generalizable representations than distributed SGD. Theoretical guarantees are presented for a multi-task linear regression setting and further empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of learning representations with image classification tasks. The theoretical analysis presented can be an important building block for the study of more complex settings in federated optimization. All reviewers recommend acceptance.  Please take the (few) suggestions by the reviewer into account, and also incorporate the explanations and clarifications provided during the rebuttal in the camera ready version.
0	This paper presents a method for unsupervised learning of disentangled representations by first training a VAE with a tangled set of latents, and then sequentially learning disentangled latent variables one at a time from the entangled initial VAE latent space. On several toy disentanglement benchmarks, the method is shown to perform competitively with previous VAE and GAN approaches.   There were several concerns from reviewers around the clarity and description of the proposed one-factor-at a time (OAT) training procedure. While the updated draft addressed several typos and some clarity issues, multiple reviewers continued to find the method description problematic. There were additional concerns around the viability of the method on real-world datasets where the number of factors are not known, and as the authors stated the proposed method can also result in one factor of variation encoded into mulitple latent variables, which hurts on many of the disentanglement metrics.  The addition of CelebA downstream task evaluation begins to address this concern of real-world data, but more rigorous experiments (including more description of how models were selected) and discussion of the limtiations of the proposed method are needed. There is also no theoretical motivation as to why the proposed intervention-based factor learning algorithm should recover the ground truth factors.  Given the concerns over experimental results, clarity, and lack of theoretical motivation, I suggest rejecting this paper in the current form.
1	This paper presents a rich dataset aimed at creating supervision for 2D cartoon tasks. The dataset is created by procedurally converting open source 3D computer graphics movies/shorts into "flattened" 2D frames. Care is taken in describing both the motivation and limitations of this approach. In an area with a dearth of good data, this paper's contributions are warmly welcomed. Reviews appreciated these aspects of the paper while highlighting potential weaknesses that appear addressed in the revisions. I recommend accepting this paper to the NeurIPS 2022 Datasets and Benchmarks program.
1	The theory and results presented in this paper provide a new method to avoid collapse in contrastive learning.  All but one reviewer recommend acceptance.  The lone negative reviewer is concerned with the limited experiments, but the other reviewers, and the AC, find the experimentation convincing enough to warrant acceptance.
1	I thank the authors for their submission and active participation in the discussions. All reviewers are unanimously leaning towards acceptance of this paper. Reviewers in particular liked that the paper is presenting an interesting and systematic study of reward hacking [GVMn] that is useful to the research community [bfGN] and targets an important problem [uYeb] in a rigorous way [16uL]. I thus recommend accepting the paper, but I strongly encourage the authors to further improve their paper based on the reviewer feedback, in particular in regards to improving positioning with respect to related work and a better formalization of their work.
1	The paper provides novel guarantees for the well-studied distributed sparse regression problem. Their theoretical results improve upon the state of the art and extend to settings that many previous results could not handle. From a technical perspective, their result builds upon previous frameworks, but also requires a number new, novel ideas. The paper does have some downsides; as mentioned previously, some of their ideas do build quite strongly off of previous work, and the presentation of the paper is quite dense, as several reviewers noted. However, the consensus of the reviewers overall is that the technical contribution of the paper is above the bar for acceptance, and would be of interest to the distributed optimization community.
1	This paper studies the problem of producing distribution-free prediction sets using conformal prediction that are robust to test-time adversarial perturbations of the input data. The authors point out that these perturbations could be label and covariate dependent, and hence different from covariate-shift handled in Tibshirani et al 19, the label-shift handled in Podkopaev and Ramdas 21, and the f-divergence shifts of Cauchois et al 2021.   The authors propose a relatively simple idea that has appeared in other literatures like optimization but appears to be new to the conformal literature: (i) use a smoothed (using Gaussian noise on X, and inverse Gaussian CDF) nonconformity score function, in order to control its Lipschitz constant, (ii) utilize a larger score cutoff than the standard 1-alpha quantile of calibration scores employed in conformal prediction. The observation that point (i) alone lends some robustness to adversarial perturbations of the data is interesting. As several experiments in the paper and responses to reviewers show, this comes at the (apparently necessary) price of larger prediction sets.   I read through all the comments and also the supplement. The authors have responded very well to all the reviewers questions/concerns, adding significant sections to their supplement as a result. Three reviewers are convinced, but one remaining reviewer requested additional experiments to compare with Cauchois et al (in addition to all the others already produced by the authors originally and in response to reviewers). However, the authors point out that the code in the aforementioned paper was not public, but they were able to privately get the code from the authors during the rebuttal period. At this point, I recommend acceptance of the paper even without those additional experiments, since it is not the authors' fault that the original code was not public. Nevertheless, I suggest to the authors that, if possible, they could add some comparisons to the camera-ready since they now have the code.  I congratulate the authors on a nice work, a very solid rebuttal, and also the astute reviewers on pointing out various aspects that could be improved.   Minor point for the authors (for the camera-ready): I would like to comment on the Rebuttal point 4.4 in the supplement, which then got further discussed in the thread. The reviewer points out four references [R1-R4]. I will add one more to the list [R5] https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10634.pdf (Kivaranovic et al, appeared in 2019, published in 2020). I think the literature reviews in this area are starting to be messy, and all authors need to do a better job. Clearly, the original paper of Vovk et al already establishes various types of conditional validity (and calls it PAC-style guarantee), produces guarantees that others in this area produce, and it appears that much recreation of the wheel is occurring. For eg, [R2, R4] do not cite [R5], despite [R5] appearing earlier and being published earlier, and having PAC-style guarantees and experiments with neural nets, etc. However, in turn, [R5] do not cite Vovk [R1], but [R2, R4] do cite [R1]. (And [R3] does not seem to be relevant to this discussion of conditional validity?) In any case, I am not sure any of these papers need citing since the current paper does not deal with conditional validity. If at all, just one sentence like "Conditional validity guarantees, of the styles suggested by Vovk [2012], would be an interesting avenue for future work".
1	The paper introduces a procedure to control the churn (i.e. differences in the predictive model due o retraining) using distillation.  This is a strong paper, with novel technique which is clearly presented, and is backed by sound theory. The experimental results were also deemed extremely convincing by reviewers TJ4g and pZBb.   Reviewer nqfu raised a question about the similarities between churn reduction and domain adaptation. The authors have addressed this by pointing out similarities to their work but also noting that, in the settings mentioned by the reviewer, alternative approaches such as completely retraining the model might be more appropriate. This part of the rebuttal is convincing.  Reviewer TJ4g has pointed out several points of improvement, to which the authors have responded adequately.  All in all, this paper is ready for and deserving of acceptance.
1	The paper describes a self-supervised learning method based on an information maximization criterion that naturally prevents dimensional collapse. The authors consider the Shannon mutual information under the assumption that the data is Gaussian. A first-order approximation to the log-determinant of the sum of two matrices is used to simplify the final objective. Experiments on 4 image datasets show that the proposed approach gives better results than contrastive and non-contrastive methods.  Strengths:  1 - The paper is well written and easy to follow. 2 - The paper is theoretically grounded on correlative information measure of representation. 3 - Strong results on some downstream classification problems. 4 - Initially the experiments included only one downstream task regarding classification, but the paper has been updated to include also results for object segmentation and detection task. 5 - Novel and well motivated. 6 - state-of-the-art SSL performance.  Weaknesses:  - Some weaknesses are pointed out by reviewer GZwK, but these are not well justified.  Decision:  A majority of reviewers vote for acceptance. The only reviewer voting slightly towards rejection is GZwK, with a reasoning that is not well justified. For example, the main criticisms mentioned by reviewer GZwK  - The paper directly generalizes the earlier proposed log-determinant mutual information to the field of self-supervised learning.  - this paper does not give a deep-going analysis that why the second-order statistics can play a important role in self-supervised learning  are not mentioned by any of the other reviewers.  Because of this, I have decided to accept the paper.
1	This paper proposes environment fields, a representation that models reaching distances within a scene. Dense environment fields are learnt using a neural network, and the effectiveness of this representation is shown on 2D maze environments and 3D indoor environments. This paper received hugely contrasting reviews, with two reviewers being very supportive and one reviewer providing the lowest score of 1. In light of this, I'll start with providing my takeaways on the review and discussion with reviewer z3Y4 (rating of 1) and then proceed to the remaining discussion.  Reviewer z3Y4 has provided the score of 1 and has made strong remarks that include: "what is proposed in this paper is simply not comprehensible", "description of the method itself is simply devoid of all required detail", "The main claims of the paper are incorrect or not at all supported by theory or empirical results." and " what is being proposed in this paper is simply too unclear and vague to be assessed". **Such dismissive remarks, in my opinion, are completely unnecessary and create a toxic discussion and review environment.**  Reviewer z3Y4 has many criticisms of the submission, but the primary ones include: (a) the lack of details throughout the paper (b) the positioning of the paper in the abstract and introduction, and (c) the lack of experiments in continuous environments. Re (a): It is well understood in our research community that providing every last detail in the main submission is nearly impossible due to the restriction on the number of pages. Providing excess details in the main paper also often reduces the readability of the paper. Such details are better addressed in the appendix and crucially, the code. The authors have provided some details in the appendix and have indicated that they will release a code base.  I also agree with the authors that justifying every last detail in the network architecture such as choice of an activation function is not necessary for this submission. The same goes with describing methods in past works in detail vs referring the reader to the appropriate citation. As a result, I believe that the authors have addressed (a) well. Re (b): This has also been addressed by the authors, by pointing out relevant parts of the paper that had the necessary details. Re (c): In this regard, the paper clearly contains a well laid out experiment in 3D indoor scenes, so as far as I am concerned, this has been addressed in the main submission.  Reviewers AhgQ and fAEP have supported this submission but also laid out some concerns that include: (1) Are the gradients suboptimal ? (2) Positioning the paper with regards to past works (3) Motivation behind using the VAE (4) Qualitative analysis and failures The authors have addressed these 4 concerns well using the rebuttal as well as via a revision of the appendix. The reviewers, post discussion have indicated their satisfaction with the revised submission.  I think this paper is interesting and proposes a novel scene representation which can be useful for others in the Embodied AI community. I am in agreement with reviewers AhgQ and fAEP, and in spite of the strong reject score by z3Y4, I recommend accepting this paper.
1	This paper introduces the first NAS benchmarks on graphs. Ratings were quite diverse, with scores of 4,5,6,7,7,8. The many positive reviewers highlighted that GraphNAS is very relevant and that a benchmark for them would be very useful for the community. The benchmark includes comprehensive evaluations on as many as 9 different datasets, which may also help facilitate research on meta-learning for (Graph)NAS. Initially, the code for creating the benchmark and analysis was not available, which is a no-go for tabular NAS benchmarks, but the authors fixed this in the rebuttal period. The most negative reviewer, 8asK, appears to not be familiar with tabular NAS benchmarks and their usefulness, and did not react to the discussion about it, as well as to the modification of the paper to highlight it. The other borderline negative review, by reviewer LkTe, had as their main ciriticism that NAS methods should be benchmarked on many spaces, but the point of tabular NAS benchmarks is *not* to provide a conclusive assessment of the performance of NAS methods that holds in general across search spaces (as a "horserace" paper might try to achieve), but rather to facilitate the cheap evaluation of current and future NAS methods on a single search space. For these reasons, I do agree more with the positive reviewers and recommend acceptance of this work as a poster.
1	Reviewers agree that this paper presents a systematic study on the impact of hyper-parameters and training strategies of previous works. Based on those empirical observations, they propose a simplified model with layer reduction and single-stage distillation, which do not rely on a complicated and ad-hoc training strategy. Extensive experiments are conducted with thorough comparison with existing works. Authors also clearly point-out their current limitations.  The major concern is that this paper is more focused on discussion of the effectiveness of training strategies in previous methods, while the theoretical contribution is somehow limited. It would be much better if authors could explain their observations (more training epochs is needed while additional distillation stages can be discarded) from a theoretical perspective, although this may be far out of the scope of this work. Nonetheless, this paper presents valuable empirical study over existing Transformer compression methods and may inspire following research; therefore, AC recommends acceptance.
1	This paper proposes a methodology to create cheap NAS surrogate benchmarks for arbitrary search spaces. Certainly, the work is interesting and useful, with comprehensive studies to validate such approach. It should be credited as belonging to the first efforts of introducing and comprehensively studying the concept of surrogate NAS benchmarks. In AC's opinion, it is a solid paper that will (or has already) inspire many follow up works. The paper is well written.   This paper received highly mixed ratings. Although the authors might not see, all reviewers actually participated in the private discussions. Reviewer 1eb8 indicated hesitation in her/his support. Reviewer yTPb stated that if not considering the arXiv complicacy, she/he "would certainly raise score by one level".  AC also reached out to Reviewer yTPb about her/his mentioned possibility of updating scores, and got confirmed that her/his original opinions wasn't changing after rebuttals. Besides, AC agrees the arXiv/NeurIPS complicacy shouldn't brought into the current discussion, and ignored that factor during decision making.   The main sticking (and considered-as-valid) critique is on the relatively outdated and incomplete selection of baselines. As a benchmark paper, it should capture and diversify the recent methods. For example, the authors might consider adding: https://botorch.org/docs/papers (latest methods in Bayesian Optimization) https://github.com/facebookresearch/LaMCTS (latest methods in Monte Carlo Tree Search) https://facebookresearch.github.io/nevergrad/ (latest methods in Evolutionary algorithms)  Given the above concerns, AC considers this paper to sit on the borderline, and perhaps with pros outweighing the cons. Hence, a weak accept decision is recommended at this moment.
1	This paper proposes measures of consistency between back-doored and clean models, proposes regularization using those consistency measures, and showcases that such trained models indeed exhibit better consistency. Also, it is demonstrated that the fine-tuned model does not deviate too far from the original clean model. The reviewers' comments are all well addressed. Some concerns related to the notion of consistency and how it relates to the detection of backdoors are still left open, but the reviewers seem to be satisfied with the answers. Given the overwhelmingly positive reviews, I propose accept.
1	The paper introduces the maximum n-times coverage, a new NP-hard (and non-submodular) optimization problem. It is shown that the problem can naturally arise in ML-based vaccine design, and two heuristics are given to solve the problem. The results are used to produce a pan-strain COVID vaccine.   The reviewers and I think that this is an interesting paper with a compelling application. There were some concerns about theoretical novelty and biological accuracy but these were addressed during the author response period. Given this, I am delighted to recommend acceptance. Please incorporate the feedback in the reviews in the final version of the paper.
1	The paper proposes latency-aware spatial-wise dynamic neural networks under the guidance of a latency prediction mode. reviewers arrived at a consensus to accept the paper.
1	While two our of three reviewers pointed out that the method is very similar to a previously published approach, DODNet,  these reviewers still see value in the extensive evaluation presented in this paper, and both suggested weak accept. The first reviewer also increased the score to borderline after the rebuttal owing to additional experiments for evaluation. I also agree with the reviewers that this paper addresses an important problem in the field, i.e.  partially labelled data, and presents extensive evaluation and benchmarking against important baseline approaches, and therefore suggest acceptance of this paper.
1	This paper builds upon existing works to prove that learning (correlated) equilibrium can be fast, i.e., faster than \sqrt{n} even in extensive form games.  Three reviewers are rather lukewarm, and one reviewer is more positive (but seems less confident in his score). The two major criticisms is that this paper is very difficult to read and that the results might seem rather incremental with respect to the literature.  I tend to agree with both points but the paper still as merits: the reason is that extensive form games are intrinsically way harder than normal form games and they more or less all have a burden of notations. We agreed  that the authors actually did some efforts to make it fit within the page limit. but another a conference or a journal would have been better suited than ICLR.  Our final conclusion is that the result is interesting yet maybe not breathtaking for the ICLR community; we are fairly certain that another venue for this paper will be more appropriate and that it will be accepted in the near future (I can only suggest journals based on the large amount of content and notations, such as OR, MOR, or GEB - yet, conferences such as EC should be more scoped too) . It does not, unfortunately, reach the ICLR bar.
1	As both reviewers stated, this paper is a good fit for the workshop, with several positives.  I am not repeating all of them here, since I agree with the reviewers' assessment comments. From the a given a natural language instruction and an input and an output scene, the paper investigates how to  train a neuro-symbolic model which  manipulates a program that can be executed by a robot on the input scenes and generates a goal state. The authors carry out experiments to demonstrate how the neuro-symbolic model is end-to-end and show generalization to novel scenes and instructions.  I recommend acceptance of this paper, as it can lead to relevant directions in neuro-symbolic robotics.
1	This paper provides two routines to replace gradient updates with low-rank unitary updates, and provides extensive technical discussion and experiments.  Reviewers are uniformly positive, and I also voice similar praises, e.g., I too appreciate the extensive discussion in appendices A and B, and the detailed experiments in the later appendices.  As such, it is easy to recommend acceptance, and I will push for this to receive at least a spotlight.  Even so, I urge the authors to make careful revisions for remaining issues raised by the reviewers, and to perform a full pass of their own.
1	This paper proposes a discrete and compositional representation of goal states for goal-conditioned RL. The idea is to learn a goal representation via self-supervised learning and discretize the learned representation via VQ-VAE, and finally use the learned goal representation for goal-conditioned RL. The proposed method improves performance on several goal-conditioned RL benchmarks.  All of the reviewers found the idea simple and reasonable, and the results on a variety of benchmarks are quite comprehensive and strong. Although there were concerns around why the proposed discretized representation forms a semantically meaningful latent space and where the improvement comes from, the authors addressed them during the rebuttal period with updated results. All of the reviewers became in favor of the paper as a result. Thus, I recommend accepting this paper.
0	The paper proposes new techniques for improving the generalization ability of deep learning models for Knowledge Tracing (KT). Instead of designing more sophisticated models, the paper investigates simple data augmentation techniques that can be applied to train existing models. In particular, three different augmentation strategies are proposed based on replacement, insertion, and deletion in the training data. These strategies are then applied with appropriate regularization loss ensuring consistency and monotonicity in the training process. Extensive experiments are performed using three popular neural models for KT and four publicly available datasets. Overall, the paper studies an interesting problem in an important application domain of online education. The results are promising and open up several exciting follow-up research directions to explore more complex data augmentation techniques for KT.  I want to thank the authors for actively engaging with the reviewers during the discussion phase and sharing their concerns about the quality of the reviews.  The reviewers generally appreciated the paper's ideas; however, there was quite a bit of spread in the reviewers' assessment of the paper (scores: 4, 5, 6, 7). In summary, this is a borderline paper, and unfortunately, the final decision is a rejection. The reviewers have provided detailed and constructive feedback for improving the paper. In particular, the authors should incorporate the reviewers' feedback to better position the work w.r.t. the existing literature on data augmentation and state of the art results, better motivate the data augmentation strategies in the context of educational applications possibly through additional data analysis, and add more ablation studies w.r.t. the hyperparameters associated with data augmentation. This is exciting and potentially impactful work, and we encourage the authors to incorporate the reviewers' feedback when preparing future revisions of the paper.
1	The paper introduces a new procedure to initialize the optimisation in training process of DNN models, including the recent ViT architecture. All the reviewers recommend acceptance and appreciate the promising empirical results backed by the strong theoretical foundations. AC recommends acceptance as well.
1	The AC has taken into account all strengths and weaknesses mentioned by reviewers in making a recommendation for this paper. Here is the summary of what was considered in carefully considering a final decision:  * Reviewers agree that the presented resource, the Dollar Street dataset, addresses a need for models that can be held more accountable in terms of geographic diversity and demographic diversity.  * There is generally no issues in terms of methodology or soundness of the proposed resource. * Unfortunately, experiments on demonstrating the usefulness of this resource are limited, and largely replicate what was already found in Devries et al. 2019, a workshop paper at CVPR from three years ago which also used the same source of data -- and at the same scale. The analysis in this previous paper in some way go further by matching image categories using human evaluators individually for each image -- as pointed out by reviewer dcyB. * The dataset was downloaded from a third party's website and as such the authors had no control in how the images were collected, nor there was any effort to enhance this resource in terms of annotations, diversity or size. * The dataset size is 38k images which is a rather small dataset for training or enhancing a model, and its use would be limited mostly as a benchmark dataset. As a benchmark however experiments seem limited as pointed by reviewer eAoC. An experiment on training on this dataset and evaluating on this dataset is performed only with a Resnet network, however it is hard to assess what is the significance of this experiment.   There are various suggestions made by reviewers below that would enhance the quality of this paper. Despite shortcomings, reviewers are still enthusiastic to see this dataset in an easy to use format as a benchmark. I also strongly suggest the authors to revise their section on licensing where it says "Training machine learning models on public domain work is widely accepted legally." as it does not seem appropriate for this paper to be making determinations or recommendations as to what is considered legal or not.
1	My main concern, that was addressed by the reviewers and was not answered by the authors, is that the improvement is q times faster algorithm for an algorithm that takes time exponential in q. In addition, the missing experimental results makes this a very theoretical paper.  Still, I recommend to accept the paper due to the significance of the problem, and conditioned on the promise of the authors to update the requested changes in the final verison.
1	This work addresses a novel and important real-world setting for semi-supervised learning – the open-world problem where unlabeled data may contain novel classes that are not seen in labeled data.  The paper provides an approach by combining three loss functions: a supervised cross-entropy loss, a pairwise cross-entropy loss with adaptive uncertainty margin, and a regularization towards uniform distribution.    The authors were responsive to reviewers’ comments and have respectively improved their paper by adding experiments, including an ablation study of each component of the objective function, study of the effect regularization on unbalanced class distributions, reporting accuracy on pseudo-labels.  While two reviewers have slightly increased their scores, some concerns still remain.  This is a borderline paper, and after some discussion and calibration, we decided that the work in its current form does not quite meet the bar for acceptance.
1	I thank the authors for their submission and active participation in the discussions. This paper introduces a method for learning a policy that can ask an expert for help, i.e., to obtain the expert action. On the positive side, reviewers found the method to be general [uya8], original and significant [gw2r], intruiging in terms of being able to reuse an existing policy [HGan], and tackling an important problem [rsmr,bRWC], and the paper to be clear [uya8,gw2r,rsmr,bRWC]. In terms of negative points, reviewers were concerned about the novelty [bRWC], unimpressive qualitative results despite strong quantitative results [bRWC], and issues with the range of baselines [bRWC,rsmr] and ablations considered [uya8]. Overall, the paper is borderline. However, bRWC indicated they would raise their score but I don't see this being reflected. Furthermore, in my view reviewer rsmr's concerns regarding baselines and ablations has been addressed by the author rebuttal. Thus, I am siding with reviewers gw2r and HGan, and recommend acceptance. However, I very strongly encourage the authors to further improve their paper based on the reviewer feedback, in particular the points raised by reviewer bRWC regarding the importance of the Success Prediction component of the method.
1	Authors present a method for single object tracking (SOT) that is entirely comprised of transformers. The architecture is simple:   1) Swin is used to generate embeddings for both template and search region 2) Embeddings are concatenated 3) An encoder transformer performs MHSA of the embeddings. 4) A decoder performs cross-attention from search tokens to template tokens and a special "motion token" which is constructed from a linear operation over the prior motion trajectory relative to the frame.  5) Output token is fed to final layers that perform IoU aware classification and bounding box regression.  Evaluations are performed on 5 SOT datasets, achieving SOTA on all of them.

1	The paper proposes a novel curriculum learning method for RL based on the concept of boosting. The proposed method builds on the curriculum value-based RL framework and uses boosting to reuse action-values from previous tasks when solving the current task. The method is analyzed theoretically in terms of approximation accuracy and convergence. Moreover, extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the method. The reviewers acknowledged the importance of the studied problem setting and generally appreciated the results. I want to thank the authors for their detailed responses that helped in answering some of the reviewers' questions and increased their overall assessment of the paper. At the end of the discussion phase, there was a clear consensus that the paper should be accepted. The reviewers have provided detailed feedback in their reviews, and we strongly encourage the authors to incorporate this feedback when preparing a revised version of the paper.
0	This paper proposes a distributed containerized multi-agent reinforcement learning(CMARL) framework that addresses three challenges in MARL: 1) Demanding data transfer. 2) Inter-process communication. 3) Effective Exploration. Using a container that collects environment experiences from parallel actors into buffers and learns local policies, CMARL demonstrates notable performance improvements with respect to time as compared to state-of-the-art benchmarks.  Although the reviewers acknowledge that the paper addresses a relevant topic, proposes an effective method, and is well written, after reading the authors' feedback and discussing their concerns, the reviewers reached a consensus about rejecting this paper in its current form. They feel that the contribution is too incremental and that the experimental comparisons are somehow unfair.  I suggest the authors take into consideration the reviewers' suggestions while preparing an updated version of their paper for one of the forthcoming machine learning conferences.
0	The paper proposes a method to generate attention masks to interpret the performance of RL agents. Results are presented on a few ATARI games. Reviewers unanimously vote for rejecting the papers. R1, R3 give a score of 5, whereas R4, R5 give a score of 4. Their concerns are best explained in their own words:   R1 says, "The use of attention maps to analyze and explain deep neural networks is not new in itself, and learning attention maps to improve vision tasks is not new either."  R3 says, "the analysis of the learned attention masks seems selective. Some automatic metrics or systematic studies of different game categories (shooting, maze-like, and ball-and-paddle) may shed light on the learned attention's general property."  R5 says, "I am still not convinced by the quality of the provided visual explanations nor am I convinced that the attention is well correlated with the current frame (the additional experiments provided do help somewhat in this regard, but are not extensive and reasonably inconclusive"  In their rebuttal, to address R1's concern authors suggested that the use of attention on both value and policy networks is novel. This is not sufficient, because it does not show why such attention maps are more useful than ones proposed by prior work. As suggested by reviewers, a systematic study or a human study clearly showing that the proposed method adds more interpretability is critical. However, this is missing.  In response to R3, the authors provided experiments on more games. But this is not the point -- because it's not about the number of environments in which experiments are provided, but rather the nature of the analysis that is performed. Finally, R5 comments that it's unclear whether attention actually provided interpretability or not.   Due to the lack of convincing analysis that demonstrates the utility of the proposed method in advancing the understanding of decisions made by RL agents, I recommend that the paper be rejected.
1	The paper's stated contributions are:  (1) a new perspective on learning with label noise, which reduces the problem to a similarity learning (Ie, pairwise classification) task  (2) a technique leveraging the above to learn from noisy similarity labels, and a theoretical analysis of the same  (3) empirical demonstration that the proposed technique surpasses baselines on real-world benchmarks  Reviewers agreed that (1) is an interesting new perspective that is worthy of study. In the initial set of reviews, there were concerns about (2) and (3); for example, there were questions on whether the theoretical analysis studies the "right" quantity (pointwise vs pairwise loss), and a number of questions on the experimental setup and results (Eg, the computational complexity of the technique). Following a lengthy discussion, the authors clarified some of these points, and updated the paper accordingly.  At the conclusion of the discussion, three reviewers continued to express concerns on the following points:  - *Theoretical justification*. Following Theorem 3, the authors assert that their results "theoretically justifies why the proposed method works well". The analysis indeed provides some interesting properties of the reduction, such as the fact that it preserves learnability (Appendix F), and that the "total noise" is reduced (Theorem 2). However, a complete theoretical justification would involve guaranteeing that the quantity of interest (Ie, the clean pointwise classification risk) is guaranteed to be small under the proposed technique. Such a guarantee is lacking.    - This is not to suggest that such a guarantee is easy -- as the authors note, this might involve a bound that relates pointwise and pairwise classification in multi-class settings, and such bounds have only recently been shown for binary problems -- or necessary for their method being practical useful (per discussion following Theorem 3). Nonetheless, without such a bound, there are limits to what the current theory justifies about the technique's performance in terms of the final metric of interest.  - *Comparison to SOTA*. Reviewers noted that the gains of the proposed technique are often modest, with the exception of CIFAR-100 with high noise. Further, the best performing results are significantly worse than those reported in two recent works, namely, Iterative-CV and DivideMix. The authors responded to the former in the discussion, and suggested that they might be able to combine results with the latter. While plausible, given that the latter sees significant gains (Eg, >40% on CIFAR-100), concrete demonstration of this point is advisable: it is not immediately apparent to what extent the gains of the proposed technique seen on "simple" methods (Eg, Forward) would translate more "complex" ones (Eg, DivideMix).   - In the response, the authors also mentioned that (at least the initial batch of) the experiments are intended to be a proof-of-concept. This would be perfectly acceptable for a work with a strong theoretical justification. However, per above, this point is not definitive.  - *Creation of Clothing1M*. The authors construct a variant of Clothing1M which merges the classes 3 and 5. Given that prior work compares methods on the original data, and that this potentially reflects noise one may encounter in some settings, it is advisable to at least report results on the original, unmodified version.  - *Issues with clarity*. There are some grammatical issues (Eg, "is exact the"), typos (Eg, "over 3 trails"), notational inconsistencies (Eg, use of C for # of classes in Sec 2, but then c in Sec 3.1), and imprecision in explanation (Eg, Sec 3.2 could be clearer what precise relationships are used from [Hsu et al. 2019]).   - These are minor but ought to be fixed with a careful proof-read.  Cumulatively, these points suggest that the work would be served by further revision and review. The authors are encouraged to incorporate the reviewers' detailed comments.
1	This paper presents a novel neural network architecture to predict interacting residues among two interacting proteins, and evaluates its performance on benchmarks. While the reviews were initially mixed, there has been a productive discussion and significant improvements in the paper during the discussion, including in particular much needed clarifications about the proposed methods, and more experimental results with an ablation study to better assess the benefits of various design choices. While no reviewer is willing to champion this paper as a "strong accept", due to the relatively modest novelty compared to existing methods, there is a consensus towards "weak accept" given the final quality of the work presented and potential usefulness of the method for the problem tackled.
1	The authors propose a particle-based entropy estimate for intrinsic motivation for pre-training an RL agent to then perform in an environment with rewards. As the reviewers discussed, and also mentioned in their reviews, this paper bears stark similarity to work of 5 months ago, presented at the ICML 2020 Lifelong ML workshop, namely, "A Policy Gradient Method for Task-Agnostic Exploration", Mutti et al, 2020--MEPOL. What is novel here is the adaptation of this entropy estimate to form an intrinsic reward via a contrastive representation and the subsequent demonstration on standardized RL environments.  The authors have added a comparison to MEPOL, and in these experiments, APT outperforms this method, sometimes by some margin. Unfortunately this work does not meet the bar for acceptance relative to other submissions.
1	This paper proposes a Role Diversity metric, meant to quantify how different roles are in a multi-agent RL setting. There's actually three versions of this metric, or three aspects (the distinction is not entirely clear to this area chair).  The reviewers are generally not very enthusiastic about the paper, with scores hovering at or just below the acceptance threshold. There has been extensive discussion between reviewers and authors, but there a sense that there is confusion about the exact purpose and contribution of the paper. This is reinforced by the authors' "letter to area chair", which outlines several ways the reviewers have not gotten the message. Reading the paper, it appears to me that the root cause is that the authors are indeed not communicating clearly what the paper contributes and why. It is, after all, the authors' responsibility that the reviewers understand the work. My own impression is that the text is dense and not particularly easy to get through. Perhaps the authors are simply trying to cram too many contributions into a single conference paper? This is a classic error which leads to hard-to-read papers. In addition to this, there is a lingering concern about the generalizability of the proposed methods.  I think the authors need to work more on their presentation, and perhaps reconsider which parts to include in their paper and exactly which measure they want to send, before they submit to another venue.
1	While some of the scores on this paper are mixed, even the negative reviews highlight the quality and interest of the work and have specific (and somewhat debatable) technical concerns.  Overall, the AE recommends accept, especially in light of the detailed and thoughtful responses during the rebuttal phase.  In the camera ready, the authors are encouraged to see if they can squeeze some of the new results (e.g., transfer learning attempt in Figure 6 and comparisons to Shapeflow) in the main body of the paper, where they're more likely to be noticed.
1	Initially, the paper had mixed reviews (455).  The major concerns from the reviews were:  1. missing refs about unprojection. (K314) 2. quality advantage is not convincing, slightly better than FSM, while qualitative results show not obvious improvements. (K314) 3. visualize the depth maps as point clouds (K314) 4. what is the trade-off between resolution/memory, computation, and depth estimation? (K314, ZBww) 5. insufficient experiments (9Ef1) 6. comparison with monocular methods (9Ef1) 7. cubic vs spherical space? (9Ef1) 8. can it be trained on real data w/o GT supervision? (9Ef1) 9. how to handle collision of multiple pixel rays? (ZBww) 10. why use different MLPs to fuse "overlap" and "non-overlap" features? No ablation study on this. (ZBww)  The authors wrote a response to address these concerns, providing more qualitative results and ablation studies, as well as further explanations.  The reviewers were satisfied with the response, and K314 upgraded their rating to 6, while other reviewers maintained 5s. The reviewers appreciated the novel problem and the solution that can produce more consistent depth maps across views, and also synthesize depth maps in novel views. After reading the paper, the AC agrees with the reviewers, noting that the paper  addresses the limitations of the problem setup of previous work [13], thus developing a new line of research.  Thus, the AC recommends accept. The authors should prepare a revised version of the paper according to the reviews, rebuttal, and discussion.
1	The authors have introduced a method of data augmentation for image-based reinforcement learning that performs masking in the frequency domain, combined with techniques for stabilizing Q-learning, to achieve improved performance on a number of DMControl Generalization Benchmark tasks.  There was agreement among the reviewers that this work is novel and technically sound, and their concerns were mainly related to the breadth of tasks explored in the initial submission. During the review process the authors have gone to considerable effort to introduce new tasks (e.g. DrawerWorld, Robosuite and CARLA) and the improved performance of their method appears to generalize well. I believe that this work will be of broad interest to the RL community and recommend it for acceptance.
1	All reviewers suggest acceptance of this paper, which reports the relationship between perceptual distances, data distributions, and contemporary unsupervised machine learning methods.  I believe this paper will be of broad interest to different communities at ICLR.
1	Reviews were mixed here and all quite borderline. There are legitimate points raised for why this is being consistently given borderline ratings, with two in particular resonating with my own reading (novelty and comparisons with other methods). However, despite these issues the paper itself is a solid contribution, and I think could easily lead to others building on the core ideas and approach. The paper has also improved notably during revisions and at present does not have any fundamental flaws that should preclude publication. Therefore, I recommend acceptance.
0	The focus of this paper is to analyze an end to end network to reconstruct matrices originating from non-Euclidean data which are corrupted. The authors present an untrained network for this task. In the review period the reviewers raised a variety of concerns including concerns about novelty of the paper with respect to existing work, technical depth and clarity. The authors did not respond to these concerns. Therefore, I recommend rejection.
1	TAP-Vid presents a benchmark that will be highly useful for tracking research for tracking arbitrary physical points on surfaces over long video clips. The reviews are all positive, with one reviewer raising ethical aspects in preparing the benchmark.  I find the rebuttal sufficient and adequate and hence recommend acceptance of the paper.
1	The paper considers a subset of dynamic problems, in which the optimal policy is a threshold-policy. The authors use this attribute to formulate tailored off-policy actor-critic algorithms, for both MDPs and RMABs which are gradient-based, so can utilize neural networks. They empirically compare their method to SOTA methods in three MDP domains and three RMAB parameterizations, the results show that their method, DeepTOP, performs better than the compared methods in all the experiments.  The paper is well written and the claims are correct.  The performance of DeepTOP compared to the other methods is impressive.  All four reviewers were on the positive side for acceptance.
1	Dear Authors,  The paper was received nicely and discussed during the rebuttal period. There is consensus among the reviewers that the paper should be accepted:  - The new result about query complexity of regression problem that the authors have added. Along with the result on   for (noisy) Vandemonde matrix, these make the paper lie above the accept bar. - The authors have providing satisfying clarifications during the rebuttal that convinced reviewers to increase further their scores.  The current consensus is that the paper deserves publication.  Best AC
1	Meta Review: I find this paper to present an interesting perspective, analyzing the sampling bias in active learning and correcting for it.  There was some debate with Review YKx9 about the assumptions and rigor of the theory, but I found the author responses adequate.  I recommend acceptance.  The authors should take care to improve the readability of Figure 1.
0	In an attempt to understand generalization, this paper aims at understanding the dynamics of functions presented by the network for different images in the training set. Authors look at activation patterns (whether a ReLU activation is on or off) as a way of characterizing the active paths in the network and approximating the function presented by the network for each image. Authors study different related statics (eg. correlation) and how they evolve during training including.  Pros:  - Understanding the dynamics of training, how diversity is encouraged by the training procedure and its relationship to generalization is an important problem. - This paper takes an empirical approach and tries to make interesting empirical observations about the dynamics of the training.  Cons: - The paper is poorly written in terms of structure, making clear arguments with enough evidence, notation, etc. - Some empirical trends are shown but their connections to the main claim of the paper about generalization is very weak. The main attempt to connect the observations to generalization is Fig. 7 which shows model accuracy correlated with the ratio of early to mid overlap. This is problematic both because it only has 6 data points and also because a simple correlation analysis is not enough to establish this claim which is more about the cause of generalization.  Reviewers have pointed to various concerns including but not limited to clarity of the paper, lack of rigorous arguments, not providing enough evidence for the arguments, etc. Unfortunately, authors did not participate in the discussion period.  Given the above concerns, I recommend rejecting the paper.
1	Reviewer KVLA raises some concerns on the completeness of this paper, suggesting that this paper needs further improvements for publication. Based on the comments of both reviewers, this paper is accepted as a long paper. Please address the reviewers' comments in the final version.
1	The main topic of this work is stochastic bilevel optimization. It provides an efficient algorithm for this task, and provides theoretical results in this setting.    The reviewers are unanimous that this is well-presented work of high quality and should be accepted, and so do I.
1	The paper proposes an approach for learning a decomposition of a scene into 3D objects using single images without pose annotations as training data. The model is based on Slot Attention and NeRF. Results are demonstrated on CLEVR and its variants.   The reviewers point out that the method is reasonable and the paper is quite good, but even after considering the authors' feedback agree that the paper is not ready for acceptance. In particular, the key concern is around experimental evaluation - that it is performed on one dataset (and variants thereof) and that the evaluation of the 3D properties of the model is not sufficiently convincing: it does not outperform 2D object learning methods on segmentation and is not compared to those on "snitch localization".  Overall, this is a reasonable paper, and the results are promising but somewhat inconclusive, so I recommend rejection at this point, but encourage the authors to improve the paper and resubmit to a different venue.  (One remark. The paper makes a point of not using any annotation. It is technically true, but in practice on CLEVR unsupervised segmentation works so well that it's basically as if segmentation masks were provided. If the authors could demonstrate that their method - possibly with provided coarse segmentation masks - works on more complex datasets, it would be a nice additional experiment)
1	This paper provides an interesting generalized perspective on SSL techniques and proposes a debiasing technique that can be viewed as decreasing the variance of the risk estimate. The authors argue that this leads to estimators that are better than the purely supervised estimator under a rather weak assumption called MCAR - which assumes that the probability of a missing label is independent of covariate and label.   Although the exposition and perspective are interesting, this paper is borderline for the following two main reasons:  1. A few reviewers were not convinced of the theoretical result that is supposed to show that unlabeled data strictly helps - indeed, whereas usual variance reduction techniques (e.g for optimization schemes such as SGD etc.) lead to a strict gain in terms of convergence rate, there is no clear asymptotic/high probability statement that indicates statistical gain of the corresponding estimator (which is what we really care about - not the risk estimate). The dependence of lambda_opt on theta (which changes every iteration) does not help in providing such a statement. Since this is the primary contribution of the paper, I would suggest the authors follow through with the analysis to show a gain for the actual estimator compared to the "complete case" (only using supervised data).   On that note, the authors claimed in their rebuttal that they have added an asymptotic variance analysis in Appendix I, which indeed would have made a very valuable point - however, I could only find a copy-pasted version of Theorem 3.1. in Appendix I? Similarly, Appendix F does not seem to include the comparison between debasing using labeled and unlabeled data but instead contains the proof of Theorem 3.2. Perhaps the wrong revision was uploaded, but unfortunately, given the current version, this point is not adequately addressed.  2. If the experimental results were more extensive and conclusive, then the current theorem could have perhaps been alright as a mainly methodological contribution. However, as the authors note, extensive experiments require a lot of compute power - however, given the lack of the ultimate theorem, the methodology becomes the primary contribution and would thus require more experimental evidence as the reviewers asked for.    Addressing one of the above points would push the paper above the acceptance threshold which we hope the authors can pursue in their next submission.
1	This work studies the effect of initialization scaling on the gradient flow training dynamics of three layer (two hidden layer) MLPs. . Extending Luo et al. 2021's analysis, the authors identify "linear", "critical" and "condensed" regime depending on initialization scaling parameters  Strength pointed out by the authors include, "new insight into training dynamics of MLPS with more than one hidden layer", "elegant and insightful analysis" for a "dauntingly difficult problem" and that "phase diagram is neat and valuable contribution"  Reviewer `PDY9` saw major weakness as treating the second layer as linear regime only, which makes the analysis similar to previous work (Luo et al., 2021). In general, the reviewer believes that the full comprehensive analysis on different phases for each layer is lacking. Although the reviewer did not respond to the AC, this issue has been addressed by author response. Also please do follow the recommendation of the reviewers in terms of improving writing (better description of gamma_2, gamma_3 for example), improving related works, as well as making figures more legible.   Overall, while the paper is somewhat borderline, there are interesting insights and analysis as the reviewers pointed out without critical issues. I recommend accepting this work at NeurIPS 2022.
0	The paper describes a genetic algorithm for molecular optimization under constraints. The aim is to generate molecules with better properties while close to an initial lead molecule. The proposed approach is a two-stage one. The first stage aims to satisfy constraints and searches for feasible molecules that are similar to the lead. The second stage optimizes the molecular property. The method is evaluated on logP optimization task, with minor improvement over previous work.  The reviewers point out the following strengths and weaknesses:  Strengths:  - Molecular optimization under structural constraints is an important research direction. - Comprehensive related work section.  Weaknesses:  - Lack of novelty because it is a standard application of genetic algorithm. - The results show that the proposed method did not outperform existing baselines. - The main claim of the paper (benefit of two-stage procedure) is not supported by ablation study. - The authors only conduct experiments on improving LogP, which is a benchmark that is too easy and not challenging. - The objective function and cross-over operation are the same or very similar to previous work. - The experimental evaluation is limited, and the overall setting is not very relevant to real-world tasks.  Overall, all reviewers vote for rejection. It is clear that the paper needs more work before it can be published.
1	This was a somewhat unusual submission in that the authors tried to motivate their paper by pointing to a separate anonymous manuscript.  However, the authors didn't seem to want to confirm they would merge the manuscripts when asked about this. It was thought that in fairness the submitted manuscript should be judged on its own. After discussion, it was agreed that the submitted paper on its own, did not generate enough enthusiasm to merit acceptance.
1	This paper got mixed reviews. One for reject and three for acceptance. The reviewers and authors have extensive discussion. Authors also provided additional experiments for further clarifying some questions from the reviewers. The paper has some clarify issue in the theoretical justification part as pointed out by AR1. Authors should extensively improve this part or revise the statement. However, the method proposed in this paper is simple and the results are indeed good. This paper is valuable and should be shared within the community to advance research on ZSL. Therefore, AC recommends acceptance.
1	The paper proposes a framework for characterizing harmful text generated from LLMs. This is a timely and extremely important topic, and the paper engages with the complex socio-technical questions around it. The reviewers are split in their opinions (three in favor of acceptance; three opposed). The key argument raised against the paper is that it does not introduce a new benchmark or dataset, and does not make falsifiable claims. The meta-reviewers consider the paper to be well in-scope for the track: despite lacking empirical results, it provides a "framework for responsible dataset development" and clearly identifies "significant problems with existing datasets."  The authors successfully address the other concerns. The paper makes an important contribution to the community and deserves to be accepted.
1	During the discussion among reviewers, we have shared the concern that this work has a significant overlap with [Liu et al. 2018] and [Liu & Motani 2020]. Although the authors tried to address this concern by the author response, I also think that the difference is not enough. In particular, the reviewers pointed out that Figure 1, Table 1, and Figure 3 are exactly the same with those in [Liu, 2020], and Proposition 2 in [Liu & Motani 2020] is Proposition 1 in this paper. Since these overlaps are not acceptable, I will reject the paper.
1	This paper studies the underlying training and memorization dynamics of very large language models. The main take aways are that larger-sized language models memorize training data faster, and that this memorization happens before the overfitting of language modeling. Tokens with certain part-of-speech tags (nouns, numerals) seem to be memorized faster during training.   Overall, most reviewers feel positively about this paper, agreeing that it tackles an important problem and that it provides a solid contribution. The experimental results are detailed and use reasonable metrics for data memorization, including the forgetting identifier experiments. Some of the weaknesses that have been pointed out (e.g. regarding the significance of the part-of-speech tags experiment, clarifying the criteria for memorization, etc.) seem to have been well addressed during the author response. Therefore, I recommend acceptance.
1	This paper proposes a novel type of variational auto encoder, referred to as HELO. The latent space is decomposed into a content space and a motion space, and the main contribution is the proposal to model the motion space using Hamiltonian dynamics. All reviewers agree that the idea of using Hamiltonian dynamics is interesting and novel. One main critique, that the authors agreed on, was that the operator does not contain any stochasticity and that this might be a limitation when applying the idea to model more complex data. Another remark was that the experiments are limited and experiments on less constraint data are missing. A quick look at the baseline methods revealed that they also use the same kind of data sets to evaluate their methods, so this latter concern might be of minor importance.  All in all, the potential positive outcomes of this paper outweight its current limitations, so we recommend acceptance at this point, while urging authors to address the remaining concerns in the final version.
0	This paper proposed a long-term object-based memory system for robots.  The proposed method builds on existing ideas of data association filters and neural-net attention mechanisms to learn transition and observation models of objects from labelled trajectories.  The proposed method was compared with baseline algorithms in a set of experiments.  The initial reviews raised multiple concerns about the paper. Reviewers nrGQ and  V7qP commented on the conceptual gap between the problem proposed in the introduction and the extent of the experiments. Reviewer qPet understood the paper to be a form of object re-identification and was concerned about the limited comparisons with related work.  The author response clarified their goal of estimating the states of the objects in the world, which they state is different from the goals of long-term tracking and object reidentification mentioned by the reviewers.  The authors also clarified the relationship to other work in slot-attention and data association filters.    The ensuing discussion among the reviewers indicated that the paper's contribution remained unclear even after the author response. Two reviewers noted the paper did not clearly communicate the problem being solved (all reviewers had a different view of the problem in the paper).  These reviewers wanted a better motivation for the problem being addressed in this paper.  The third reviewer remained unconvinced that the problem in the paper was different from long-term object tracking.  Three knowledgeable reviewers indicate reject as the contributions of the paper were unclear to all of them. The paper is therefore rejected.
1	Meta Review: This paper proposes LIGER to better use the foundation model in a weakly-supervised setting. LIEGER has two key components: 1) a finer estimator of weak source quality by dividing the embedding space and learning the source accuracy for each part, 2) source voting expansion  in the embedding space.  The reviewers agree that the proposed work is innovative and makes a significant technical contribution in using pretrained models under weak supervision. There were some concerns raised by reviewers, but most of them have been well addressed by the authors.  I recommend acceptance of this paper given its novelty and significant technical contribution.
1	The review ratings/confidences were 5/2, 6/2, 4/4, and 5/2. Although the average rating of 5 was just above the acceptance threshold, I think that it should somehow be discounted by the lower confidence levels. Although I myself does not have expertise in the field of BCI, as for the reviewers' evaluation, I think that they basically agreed on the following points: - The problem is well motivated. - The proposed method was built on DyEnsemble with some empirically-motivated extensions to have decoder models dynamically evolving. One could then argue that the proposal is not groundbreaking but somehow incremental. - The authors showed experimentally that the proposed method works well compared with a number of other existing methods.  I also noticed that the authors made revision (adding a paragraph at the end of Section 2: It can be observed in the August 10 revision), which would have improved readability of this paper. I would thus recommend acceptance of this paper, provided that there is room for it.
1	This paper aims to study the convergence of deep neural networks training via a control theoretic analysis. This is a very interesting approach to establish theoretical understanding of deep learning. However, there are several concerns raised by the reviewers:  1. The contribution of this paper is limited. The results simply follow from standard optimal control. It is not clear what new insight the paper provides. 2. There are already quite a few works on control theoretic analysis of deep learning. This paper did not do a good job on presenting its novelty and difference with existing works. 3. The experimental part is weak. It only involves small data set and very simple networks.  Based on these, I am not able to recommend acceptance for the current manuscript. But the authors are encouraged to continue this research.
1	This paper studies the problem of choosing the best cloud provider for a task. The problem is formulated as a bandit and solved using algorithm CloudBandit. The algorithm is compared to several baselines, such as SMAC, and performs well. The evaluation is done on 60 different multi-cloud configuration tasks across 3 public cloud providers, which the authors want to share with the public.  This paper has four borderline reject reviews. All reviewers agree that it studies an important problem and that the promised multi-cloud optimization dataset could spark more research in the area of cloud optimization. The weaknesses of the paper are that it is not technically strong and that the quality of the new dataset is not clear from its description. At the end, the scores of this paper are not good enough for acceptance. Therefore, it is rejected.
1	This paper introduces a new dataset for evaluating disentanglement and its impact on out of distribution generalization based on the trifinger robotics platform. Using this dataset, the authors rigorously investigate the performance of beta-VAEs in this setting under a number of conditions, finding that weak supervision is necessary to induce disentangled representations, and that, perhaps surprisingly, disentanglement does not help for sim2real settings despite the similarity between the simulator and the real data. Reviewers were divided on the work, but had a number of concerns related to the claims of novel architecture, comparisons to baselines, and issues with the clarity of the paper, some of which were addressed in the authors' response. I agree with some of these concerns, particularly with respect to the claims of novel architectures since the modifications could simply be viewed as tweaking hyperparameters and are not rigorously compared to baselines. However, I think the novelty of the dataset and the rigorous evaluation of OOD generalization settings is likely to be valuable enough to the community to merit acceptance. I'd encourage the authors, however, to tone down some of the claims regarding the architecture (or provide sufficient baseline comparisons), and instead focus on the dataset and the OOD results. I recommend acceptance.
1	Overall, all reviewers see the novelty in the dataset that provides an original new set of tactile data, accounting for a wide range of objects and scene, collected in the wild. The paper is overall well written, clear and easy to follow, and provides a good demonstration of the importance and usefulness of the dataset, going beyond datasets collected by robots in the context of material properties. It also includes initial steps towards benchmarking, although it is not the core contribution of the paper, which lies in the creation of the dataset itself.   Two reviewers recommend acceptance, two stand marginally below acceptance, and one does recommend rejection. The authors have provided detailed responses to all reviewers’ comments and concerns and updated their manuscript. The main concerns of those reviewers sitting on the fence seem to be answered and limitations acknowledged however the element of bias in the data collection was still considered as a possible concern. Based on my reading and accounting for the authors changes, there approach itself is novel and original and hence provides already a relevant contribution to NeuroIPS; while the authors acknowledge limitations and future work avenues. The one reviewer recommending rejection didn’t engage in the discussion but from my reading of both the paper, the comments, and the authors responses, I believe the main points were addressed by the authors and misunderstandings clarified. Overall, I believe the papers offers a novel, non-existing dataset that can inspire interesting future works; all the dataset is shared and presented clearly for others to use.
1	This is a strong submission that benefitted greatly from productive and clarifying discussion between the authors and reviewers, after which the reviewers reached a unanimous stance in favor of acceptance. I recommend the authors to revise the manuscript accordingly in light of these discussions.
1	The work proposes a continuous-time generalization of diffusion models on a discrete space. The description uses continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC), in parallel to the existing stochastic differential equation description for continuous space. Reverse CTMC and modeling and ELBO objective are described. Some practical considerations and inspirations are also discussed, including avoiding exponentially large model in high dimensions, efficient reverse (generation) process simulation, and a corrector technique that further exploit the model to improve simulation (generation) quality. An error bound on the learned data distribution is also presented that shows a mild dependency on data dimensionality.  All the reviewers agree that this work presents the very right way to describe the continuous-time version of diffusion model on discrete space, and thereafter inspired techniques make a desired contribution to the community. Some concerns are raised, including still inferior performance than the continuous counterpart, and on the independence among dimensions. The authors provide reasonable remarks on them. Hence, I recommend accept to this paper.  One minor point: In Sec. 4.2, it would be clearer if the independence is specified both among the random variables $x^{1:D}$ in “output” and between each $x^d$ in “output” and $x^{1:D\backslash d}$ in “input”. Conventionally independence refers to the former, in which case the size is only reduced to $S^D \times D S^2$.
0	This paper proposes an OOD evaluation framework under three categories: irrelevant input detection, novel class detection, and domain shift detection. As with several reviewers, the AC recognizes the importance and effort to distinguish between different cases of OOD detection, as well as the amount of experimental comparison across several prominent methods in literature (MSP, MC-dropout, cosine similarity, ODIN, Mahalanobis).    Despite being well-motivated, three knowledgeable reviewers find the paper not ready yet for publication at ICLR. The AC recommends a rejection, given the standing major concerns from the reviewers. The AC is hopeful that the paper can be significantly improved by   - sufficiently discussing and highlighting the novel insights of the results.  - a more rigorous definition of  "novel" vs. "irrelevant" inputs. There seem to be overlapping definitions between what Hsu et al. considered vs. this paper. In particular,  Hsu et al distinguish i) samples of a novel class but in a known domain, called semantic shift (S), and ii) samples of known class in a novel domain, called non-semantic shift (NS), both of which are reconsidered in this paper. Therefore, the novelty of this submission is more precisely to distinguish within the category of semantic shift. The AC agrees that this might deem some more rigorous measurement and definition of "semantic closeness".  - The AC also finds the evaluation of domain shift in Section 3.3.2 may be potentially misleading the community, as it falls out of the standard OOD scope. The notion of common corruption is closer to the robustness problem (which is how ML model predictions changes w.r.t some delta changes in the input space). The changes may not be substantial enough to be "out-of-distribution".
1	Motivated by advancing the applicability of backpropagation alternatives, the paper extends predictive coding to non-Gaussian distributions, so it can be used to train effectively complex architectures such as transformers.  The reviews are divided: three reviews give a score of 7 (accept) whereas one review gives a score of 4 (borderline reject). The positive reviews cite the following strengths: clearly stated motivation, technical soundness, potential for impact and convincing experiments. The negative review cites lack of clarity as the main weakness (something also mentioned in one of the positive reviews), while the reviewer is not convinced about the originality of the method given similar advances in variational inference and generative modelling.  On balance, given the potential of impact in the field of predictive coding and the technical soundness, I'm happy to recommend acceptance, even though clarity is somewhat lacking.  Some reviewers requested more details on computational complexity, memory consumption and scalability. I encourage the authors to use the extra content page in the camera-ready version to discuss these aspects further.
1	Reviewers were mixed about this paper. The stand-out concern is clearly the fact that this paper does very little to set itself in context. I would echo these concerns, and this is clearly the single greatest weakness of the paper. For example I would highlight lines 54--62, in which the proposed technique is compared only against some nebulously-defined "other".  Despite these concerns, I am inclined to agree with reviewer QEo4 that the paper is acceptable for a workshop, and would strongly encourage the authors to address the concerns raised by reviewers.  In addition to the review comments, a few comments of my own:  - Equation (2) assumes that the SDE is solved via the Euler--Maruyama method. Whilst analytically convenient, I believe it is more elegant to treat the general case for as long as possible (without reducing to just the EM method at this early stage). If the noise has particular structure then it may become desirable to solve the SDE via some more efficient numerical method, e.g. Milstein if using commutative noise or Heun if using additive noise (Heun converges to the Stratonovich solution, but for additive noise then Itô and Stratonovich are identical). - I think equation (2) may be missing a $t_{n+1}-t_n$ coefficient for the $f$ term. - The "not too far" of line 67 is usually referred to as a "trust region".
1	Authors present a method attempting to perform Masked Auto-Encoding (MAE) using semantic knowledge, to try to better approximate the semantic MAE seen in language domain. To do this, they leverage an iBOT framework and add some embeddings of the class token to create "part tokens", which are then compared to patch tokens from iBOT to produce attention maps. The objective for this process is a StyleGAN-based image reconstruction.  Once the part attention maps training is done, the network is then used to guide semantic based part masking based on the generated attention maps, for semantic MAE.    SemMAE pretrained networks are then compared against other forms of SSL pretraining on ImageNet 1k, iNa, CUB, Cars, and ADE-20K, demonstrating improvements in all domains.  Pros: - [R] Idea is interesting / novel - [R] Well written - [AC/R] Results improve over baselines     Cons: - [AC/R] Pipeline is complicated. - [R] What about starting from random MAE and then adapting based on parts knowledge? Authors respond that this is future work. - [AC/R] Not convinced parts are visual analog of words. Authors provide benchmark improvements in performance, and qualitative visualization of the parts. However, there is no quantitative assessment of the parts and whether they have true semantic meaning. - [AC/R] Some improvements are marginal. Authors respond that although marginal in some cases, they are consistent.  - [R] Paper does not discuss more how to deal with background. Authors respond that this is future work.  Overall, all reviewers have changed their assessments to accept, including the one reject reviewer. AC recommends accept, though would be preferable if quantitative assessment of the quality of the semantic parts (for example, by segmentation masks) could be provided.  AC Rating: Accept
1	To address the problem of unauthorized use of data, methods are proposed to make data unlearnable for deep learning models by adding a type of error-minimizing noise. Based on th fact that the conferred unlearnability is found fragile to adversarial training, the authors design new methods to generate robust unlearnable examples that are protected from adversarial training. In addition, considering the vulnerability of error-minimizing noise in adversarial training, robust error-minimizing noise is then introduced to reduce the adversarial training loss. The authors have tried to respond to reviewers' comments along with adding more experiments. Overall, this manuscript finally gets three positive reviews and one negative review, where the possible vulnerability or robustness of error-minimizing noise against (simple) image processing operations was not verified. In comparison with other manuscripts I'm handling that got consistent positive comments, this manuscript is still recommended to be accepted (poster) with a further study of robustness under simple image transformations in the final version.
1	This submission studies (a somewhat non-standard version of) tolerant closeness testing of distributions over the n-dimensional hypercube. Instead of only iid samples, it is assumed that the tester is able to efficiently evaluate the probability mass at any point in the domain and to sample from the distribution conditioned on any subset of size two of the domain. The main result is an algorithm with query complexity scaling near-linearly in the dimension. Using only iid samples, one would need exponential dependence on dimension. The algorithm is evaluated on synthetic and real-world datasets. It is experimentally shown that their algorithm outperforms a previous baseline, which in the worst case has complexity scaling exponentially in the dimension. Overall, this is an interesting work that appears to meet the bar for acceptance.
1	The paper proposes a framework to perform signal processing tasks on a signal represented with an implicit neural representation directly in the representation space, without the need to instantiate the signal.   After the rebuttal period, all reviewers recommend acceptance.   In particular reviewer 1Yx6, an expert on the topic, finds the idea original, and the quality and clarity of the paper to be high. The reviewer finds that while for now the significance is limited (since working as proposed in the representation space is computationally prophibitavely expensive), this is not a major issue, since the the paper is likely to inspire work that will push the idea further.  Reviesers edqT and qGk1 also liked the general idea of the paper and find the proposed method to directly perform operations on the representation space of implicit neural representations to be novel and interesting  Reviewer Uh51 initially identified a few issues regarding experimental design, the validation, and on the included literature. The main concern regarding the experimental design of the reviewer was that the paper focuses on images (and not signal processing tasks more broadly), which I don't consider a shortcoming, due to the importance of image processing tasks. The concerns on the validation issues have been addressed as well, and the reviewer raised their score.   I recommend acceptance of the paper.
1	This paper studies inverse reinforcement learning through the prism of regularized Markov decision processes, by generalizing MaxEntIRL from the negative entropy to any strongly convex regularizer (as a side note, strict convexity might be enough for many results). The reviewers appreciated the clarity, the mathematical rigor and the empirical evaluation of this paper. They asked some questions and raised some concerns, that were mostly addressed in the rebuttal and the revision provided by the authors. This is a strong paper, for which the AC recommends acceptance.
1	This paper proposes a potentially very interesting and original approach to handle label noise.  The numerical experiments suggest that the method works very well. But the paper  itself has been deemed very hard and demanding to read and understand for a general machine learning crowd and even by experts in the fields of optimal transport and  Markov theory.   Note that due to the low confidence in several review an additional emergency review by an expert was asked and it confirmed the global opinion from  other reviewers that the paper is interesting but needs a major rewriting before acceptance in a ML conference. The AC strongly suggest that the authors work on a more pedagogical introduction and explanation of the method before resubmitting.
1	Executive summary:  The authors study the repeated allocation of an identical good over T rounds to n strategic buyers in a "no monetary transfers" setting. The buyers have i.i.d. valuations drawn from an unknown distribution, and the algorithm must work with reported valuations. The goal is to maximize social welfare (= sum of valuations) under the constraint that each buyer receives a pre-specified fraction of the total number of goods.   The main result is an algorithm for this problem that ensures two things:   (a) approximate Bayesian incentive compatibility (approx-BIC) (Definition 2 and Theorem 1) and   (b) low individual regret (Definition 3 and Theorem 2).   The key idea of the algorithm (is to exploit the iid-ness of the problem) and detect misreports from the underlying CDF using Dvoretzky-Kiefer-Wolfowitz type bounds.  Discussion and recommendation:  After some initial set back on the problem motivation, the reviewers bought into the motivation for studying this online allocation problem "without monetary transfers" (adding examples such as the foodbank example might be good).    There was some discussion around "assuming iid valuations" limiting the generality of the result, but there is in fact a history of papers that studies learning with strategic agents under this assumption (eg Kanoria and Nazerzadeh 2021).  The main difference of the current work is that it's working in a setting without money.  The idea behind the algorithm is maybe "the obvious think to do" - but of course it still requires some work to formally prove that it actually works.   I think one thing that could strengthen the paper would be to add some discussion around the tightness/non-tightness of the approximate BIC and individual regret bounds.  Weak accept.
1	This paper presents a knowledge distillation method for face recognition, by inheriting the teacher’s classifier as the student’s classifier and optimizing the student model with advanced loss functions. It received comments from three reviewers: 1 rated “Ok but not good enough - rejection”, 1 rated “Marginally below” and 1 rated “Marginally above”. The reviewers appreciate the simple yet clear methodology illustration and the well written paper. However, a number of major concerns are raised by the reviewers, including limited novelty, lack of comparison with more advanced knowledge distillation methods and their special case in face recognition. During the rebuttal, the authors made efforts to response to all reviewers’ comments. However, the rating were not changed. The ACs concur these major concerns and more comprehensive comparisons with the state of the art KD methods are necessary to better illustrate the contribution of this work. Therefore, this paper can not be accepted at its current state.
1	The paper receives unanimously positive reviews from four knowledgeable experts. They all agree that, though the saliency detection method NormGrad is not invented by the authors, its use in the context of medical image analysis shows promising results, which is clearly demonstrated by the authors. They also express some concerns, which are largely addressed by the authors in the discussions. I, therefore, recommend the acceptance of this paper.
0	This paper proposes a contribution aiming at understanding the cause of errors in few-shot learning. The motivation is interesting but the reviewers pointed out many aspects that require more precisions and polishing in addition to the fact that the upper bound provided it rather loose. The rebuttal provided addresses some concerns, but there are still some remarks that require some clarifications en work. Hence, I propose rejection.
0	The submission introduces the sparse hierarchical table ensemble (S-HTE), based on oblivious decision trees for tabular data. The reviewers acknowledged the clarity of the presentation and the importance of the computational complexity analysis. However, they also raised concerns regarding the novelty of the proposed method and the significance of the results compared to competing methods (e.g., CatBoost). Given the consensus that the submission is not ready for publication at ICLR, I recommend rejection at this point.
1	The article introduces a Bayesian approach for online learning in non-stationary environments. The approach, which bears similarities with weighted likelihood estimation methods, associate a binary weight to each past observation, indicating if this observation should be including or not to compute the posterior. The weights are estimated via maximum a posteriori.   The paper is well written, the approach is novel and its usefulness demonstrated on a number of different experiments. The original submission missed some relevant references that have been added in the revision. The approach has some limitations, highlighted by the reviewers: * it requires to solve a binary optimisation problem whose complexity scales exponentially with the size of the dataset; although the greedy procedure proposed by the authors seems to work fine on the examples shown, the approach may not be applicable to larger datasets * it requires to store all the data * it requires the traceability of the marginal likelihood  Despite these limitations, there was a general agreement that this paper offers a novel and useful contribution, and I recommend acceptance.   As noted by reviewer o4TK, I also think that the title is not very accurate. Bayesian methods naturally allow recursive updates of one's beliefs, and therefore have "memory". Maybe change the title for "Bayes with augmented selective/adaptive memory"?
1	Multiple reviewers point out the interesting improvement to mix attention maps at different layers via convolution based prediction modules. This module is sufficient to show improvements only on encoder side while comparing to concurrent work Synthesizer. However, the novelty of the work is limited as compared to other papers and the results though improved did not convince the reviewers fully to gain a strong accept.
1	The paper presents an extension of the RMLMapper tool to cover Excel features. The three reviewers agreed that the contribution is relevant to the workshop and presents a solid work. Please take into account the comments provided to include them in the camera-ready paper, try to be clear if the work presents a demo or a short research paper.  The recommendation is to accept.
0	The paper introduces a new approach for generative modeling: a diffusion process is run until it first hits a target set, and then outputs the first point that is hit.   Three reviewers generally praised the originality, technical quality, and empirical results of the paper. They found the idea very interesting and novel, and technically sound. The numerical results were judged to be compelling and fair. One concern was clarity of exposition. There seemed to be two issues: (1) there were more typos and rough edges than expected, (2) more significantly, there was some difficulty in following all details of the main method given the notational complexity and significant amount of mathematical background on diffusion processes. Reviewer FUwB gave a number of concrete suggestions for improvement.  Reviewer wpmu had a negative overall opinion and critiqued the originality, quality, and clarity. On these issues: (1) the quality concern was based on a misunderstanding that was later resolved, (2) the originality concern does not seem justified to the meta-reviewer (it is based on a shared technical tool with a not-yet-published paper), and (3) the clarity concern is similar to those raised by other reviewers (especially FUwB). Overall, the meta-reviewer does not feel that the low score (3 = “reject”) was fully justified.   In summary, overall reviewers found the paper sound and novel, with the main area for improvement being clarity of exposition about diffusion processes; one reviewer considered originality a weakness, but the meta-reviewer did not find this position well justified.
0	All reviewers recommend rejection due to limited novelty and insufficient experimental analysis. The author’s response has addressed several other questions raised by the reviewers, but it was not sufficient to eliminate the main concerns about novelty (as the method is a combination of existing techniques) and missing comparisons to justify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
1	After reading the reviews and feedbacks, I lean towards acceptance. A majority of reviewers gave a positive score after the rebuttal period and some concern were answered in the authors response. Specifically authors have shown that the recent baselines they use outperform other baselines and therefore those do not need to be added in the paper, they have also clarified some proofs and some notations. Overall, the reviewers found the method presented interesting, the paper well written and appreciated the comparison to other methods of the literature. Finally, experiments shows interesting results on large scale domains which is a sign that the proposed method could scale up.
1	*Summary:* Study isolated orientations of weights for networks with small initialization depending on multiplicity of activation functions.   *Strengths:*  - Interesting analysis of properties in early stages depending on activations.   *Weaknesses:*  - Reviewers found the settings limited.  - Reviewers found experiments limited.    *Discussion:*  In response to ejGJ authors reiterate scope of covered cases and submit to consideration that their experiments should be adequate for basic research. Reviewer acknowledges the response, but maintains their assessment (limited scope of theory, limited experiments). KucV found the experimental part limited in scope, the settings unclear (notion of early stage, compatibility with theory), and review of previous works lacking. KucV’s sincerely acknowledged authors for their efforts to address their comments and improving the manuscript, and raised their score, but maintained the experimental analysis is not fully convincing and unclear, and the comparison with prior work insufficient. zuZq also expressed concerns with the experiments and the notions and settings under consideration. They also raised questions about the comparison with standard initialization. Authors made efforts to address zuZq concerns. zuZq acknowledged this but maintained initial position that the article is just marginally above threshold. jDJ5 found the paper well written and the conclusion insightful. However, also raised concerns about the experiments the settings under consideration. Authors made efforts to address jDJ5’s concerns, who appreciated this but was not convinced to raise their score.   *Conclusion:*   Two reviewers consider this article marginally above and two more marginally below the acceptance threshold. I find the article draws an interesting connection pertaining an interesting topic. However, the reviews and discussion conclude that the article lacks in several regards that in my view still could and should be improved. Therefore I am recommending reject at this time. I encourage the authors to revise and resubmit.
1	The paper is interesting, and its focus is timely and important, given the continuing rapid rise of transformers (and their dependence of tokenization of images). All three reviewers recommend acceptance, to varying degree. The paper will be a valuable contribution to the program at ICLR.
1	This paper looks at chaos in learning in games, extending a line of work in two players zero-sum games (that I found quite restrictive in the past). It somehow reduces the class of more general games to zero-sum and cooperative games (this decomposition is already known) so that the techniques can be transposed here.  The paper is interesting, yet sometimes difficult to follow, and I am not certain that it gives many new insights.   Nonetheless, we believe its quality justify acceptance.
1	The reviewers found the ideas presented in the paper interesting -- the use of mutual information to train memory for a model, and the clear presentation. Some questions were raised about demonstrating on a more elaborate set up such as NLP tasks -- the main experiments aside from the toy experiments of copy, etc algorithmic tasks, seem to be on RL experiments, but the method has been advertised more broadly in the motivation. Another reviewer raised the question of the complexity of training multiple networks. Nevertheless, the reviewers found the paper interesting enough to recommend a weak accept and I support that recommendation.  From a reviewers lens, I was a little surprised that the paper made no mention of prior works on maximizing mutual information between features of neural networks to improve results. As an example, see the following paper [1] that uses a mutual information regularizer between states at different steps of a recurrent neural networks. There is also a rich literature of doing so for convolutional neural networks. It would have made sense to compare how the idea in the paper performed in comparison to these methods (and in a sense the ablation study which looked at randomly choosing time steps, k, (regardless of the uncertainty estimator) is an experiment in this direction). I understand that part of the paper deals with the choice of time points to increase mutual information between, and so its probably more efficient than the other alternatives, but a comparison (or discussion in related works) would have made the paper stronger.

1	Overall, all reviewers see the novelty in the dataset that provides an original new set of tactile data, accounting for a wide range of objects and scene, collected in the wild. The paper is overall well written, clear and easy to follow, and provides a good demonstration of the importance and usefulness of the dataset, going beyond datasets collected by robots in the context of material properties. It also includes initial steps towards benchmarking, although it is not the core contribution of the paper, which lies in the creation of the dataset itself.   Two reviewers recommend acceptance, two stand marginally below acceptance, and one does recommend rejection. The authors have provided detailed responses to all reviewers’ comments and concerns and updated their manuscript. The main concerns of those reviewers sitting on the fence seem to be answered and limitations acknowledged however the element of bias in the data collection was still considered as a possible concern. Based on my reading and accounting for the authors changes, there approach itself is novel and original and hence provides already a relevant contribution to NeuroIPS; while the authors acknowledge limitations and future work avenues. The one reviewer recommending rejection didn’t engage in the discussion but from my reading of both the paper, the comments, and the authors responses, I believe the main points were addressed by the authors and misunderstandings clarified. Overall, I believe the papers offers a novel, non-existing dataset that can inspire interesting future works; all the dataset is shared and presented clearly for others to use.
0	This paper presents a way to use a translation memory (TM) to improve neural machine translation.  Basically the proposed model uses a n-gram retrieve matching sentence （or pieces） and takes advantage of the useful parts using gated attention and copying mechanism.  Although the idea of leveraging TM in the context of NMT is not new,  this work seems to be a fair contribution. My major concerns are the following 1. The retrieval part  is not clearly presented, raising questions about  complexities and the noise brought by the common words. The authors should give a better exposition on the ranking mechanism.  2. The experiments are not convincing enough since the proposed model is not compared to the SOTA and the competitive models described in the prior work.  In conclusion I would suggest to reject this paper.
0	The paper proposes a novel approach for estimating the high-dimensional intensity function of a Poisson process. The proposed approach builds on generalized additive models, using lower-dimensional projections.   The reviewers noted that, although the paper is well written, the position of this paper compared to earlier related work is unclear, and the empirical evaluation of the method should be strenghtened. The authors clarified some points in their response, but the paper would still require some more modifications to be ready for publication. I therefore recommend this paper to be rejected.
1	This paper received mostly positive reviews. The reviewers praised the strong performance when compared with previous work. Also, the evaluation clearly shows the benefit of the proposed contributions in terms of performance. Most concerns raised by reviewers were properly addressed in the rebuttal.  Lack of comparison to several previous works has been noted in a comment, but the authors clarified this concern, stating that the current work is a “large deviation from prior works”. The authors promised to include the missing references into the comparison.  Given the reviews, comments, and author's answers, I suggest acceptance.
1	All the reviewers were generally happy with this paper. There were some comments about a better experimental section and maybe a better discussion of results and extensions (e.g. gap-dependent bounds, what happens in the K->L regime), but everyone felt that the manuscript as written was solid enough to merit acceptance. I encourage the authors to incorporate the discussions on these points in the final manuscript.
1	Four reviewers provided reviews for this submission. Several reviewers felt that the idea to unify core vision tasks into a sequential output format is interesting and an entirely new approach and can have a large impact on how we train vision models in the future. There were a few concerns discussed between reviewers and authors. One concern was the comparison to past works that pre-trained on ImageNet vs the proposed model that was pre-trained on Objects365. The second concern was differentiating this work with Pix2Seq. In my opinion, the authors were able to answer both questions well. Overall, given the positive reviews, novelty of the work, potential to cause a significant shift in the approach of future modeling and discussion, I recommend acceptance.
1	The reviewers found this paper novel, significant for the community, and well written. All four reviewers recommended accepting the paper. I also appreciated the numerous illustrative examples in the paper. You addressed many of the remaining questions/concerns in your rebuttal and in the author-reviewer discussion. Please, go through the reviews once more for the camera-ready and take these into account.
1	The authors describe a new method of large-batch optimisation for dense prediction computer vision tasks. The reviewers appreciate the simplicity of the method, convincing experiments and the potential practical importance. AC recommends acceptance.
1	Four reviewers have evaluated this submission with one score 6 and three scores 8. Overall, reviewers like the work and note that *a rigorous and principled approach is taken by this work*. AC agrees and advocates an accept.
0	The paper proposes a boosting algorithm for RL based on online boosting. The main advantage of the result is that the sample complexity does not explicitly depend on number of states. Post rebuttal, some of the reviewers have changed their opinion on the paper. However, overall the reviewers still seem to be on the fence about this paper. Seems like the paper combines the techniques from Hazan Singh’21 along with a frank-wolfe algorithm to deal with non-convex sets but the reviewers seem to view this as not as significant a new contribution.   I see the paper as being interesting but do agree with some of the comments of the reviewers and am leaning to a reject.
1	Thank you for submitting your paper to NeurIPS! This paper makes a valuable contribution to the scoring model literature, providing a fast and scalable algorithm to derive sparse risk scores. The reviewers uniformly appreciated the methodological approach (integrating beam search with logistic regression, diverse feature selection, and star search for choosing integer coefficients), and noted that the stand-alone Python implementation is also advantageous over competitors that rely on mathematical programming solvers. I am pleased to recommend acceptance of this practically relevant work.
1	all reviewers agree that the weaknesses of this work outweigh the few positive aspects and thus the paper cannot accepted in the current form. No rebuttal or revision was provided.
1	The paper received positive leaning reviews (2x borderline accept, 1x weak accept, 1x accept). The meta-reviewer agrees with the reviewers' assessment of the paper.
1	This paper addresses the task of unsupervised knowledge base construction. The reviewers like that the authors present a novel unsupervised approach, and are happy with the thorough experiments. However, they also point out that the approach could be motivated better, and that it makes many assumptions that are not explained properly.  We recommend acceptance but nudge the authors to consider the reviewer suggestions.
1	This paper treats the problem of running gradient descent-ascent (GDA) in min-max games with a different step-size for the two players. Earlier work by Jin et al. has shown that, when the ratio of the step-sizes is large enough, the stable fixed points of GDA coincide with the game's strict local min-max equilibria. The main contribution of this paper is an explicit characterization of a threshold value $\tau^*$ of this ratio as the maximum eigenvalue of a specific matrix that involves the second derivatives of the game's min-max objective at each (strict local) equilibrium.  This paper generated a fairly intense discussion, and the reviewers showed extraordinary diligence in assessing the authors' work. Specifically, the reviewers raised a fair number of concerns concerning the initial write-up of the paper, but these concerns were mostly addressed by the authors in their revision and replies. As a result, all reviewers are now in favor of acceptance.  After my own reading of both versions of the paper and the corresponding discussion, I concur with the reviewers' view and I am recommending acceptance subject to the following revisions for the final version of the paper: 1. Follow the explicit recommendations of AnonReviewer3 regarding the numerical simulations (or, failing that, remove them altogether). [The authors' phrase that "The theory we provide also does not strictly apply to using RMSprop" does not suffice in this regard] 2. Avoid vague statements like $\tau \to \infty$ in the introduction regarding the work of Jin et al. and state precisely their contributions in this context. In the current version of the paper, a version of this is done in page 4, but the introduction is painting a different picture, so this discussion should be transferred there. 3. A persisting concern is that the authors' characterization of $\tau^*$ cannot inform a practical choice of step-size scaling (because the value of $\tau^*$ derived by the authors depends on quantities that cannot be known to the optimizer). Neither the reviewers nor myself were particularly convinced by the authors' reply on this point. However, this can also be seen as an "equilibrium refinement" result, i.e., for a given value of $\tau$ only certain equilibria can be stable. I believe this can be of interest to the community, even though the authors' characterization cannot directly inform the choice of $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$ (or their ratio).  Modulo the above remarks (which the authors should incorporate in their paper), I am recommending acceptance.
1	The paper provides a uniform generalization bound for overparameterized neural networks using the notion of maximal information gain. The analysis relies on the eigendecay of the eigenvalues of the NTK, which has recently been the object of a lot of work in the literature, including the work of Bietti and Bach (the proof actually uses one of their key lemma).  The paper originally received a set of reviews with a large disagreement between the reviewers (including two reviewers with a negative opinion and three reviewers being more positive). After the discussion period, two reviewers kept a very negative opinion, while other reviewers slightly lowered their score. Some of the problems raised by the reviewers include the restrictions imposed on the data, a missing proof (which was eventually added by the authors), the discussion of prior work being inadequate (including for instance the differences with more classical generalization bounds), and the novelty of the analysis.  Overall, the paper clearly has some merits but some of the concerns above are too important at this stage to accept the paper. I recommend the authors address the concerns mentioned in the reviews before re-submission.
1	The reviewers agree the paper studies an interesting problem on training robust binary neural networks and the paper does a good job in evaluating the proposed approach on multiple datasets and compares well with baselines. However the paper also has some drawbacks such as the proposed method has limited novelty and is a combination of existing techniques, missing comparisons to standard training based approaches, evaluations limited to ResNets.  Overall the paper is on borderline. I suggest acceptance and encourage the authors to include all the changes that came up during discussion in the final version and discuss the limitations.
1	The paper shows the success of a relatively simple idea -- fine tune a pretrained BERT Model using Variational Information Bottleneck method of Alemi to improve transfer learning in low resource scenarios.  I agree with the reviewers that novelty is low -- one would like to use any applicable method for controlling overfitting when doing transfer learning, and of the suite of good candidates, VIB is an obvious one -- but at the same time, I'm moved by the results because of: the improvements and the success on a wide range of tasks and the surprising success of VIB over other alternatives like dropout etc, and hence I'm breaking the tie in the reviews by supporting acceptance.  Its a nice trick that the community could use, if the results of the paper are an indication of its potential.
1	Four out of five reviewers recommend acceptance of the paper with a score of 7. These reviewers praise the quality and importance of the dataset. Moreover, all reviewers acknowledge the quality of the writing.  The authors have constructively engaged into the discussion with the reviewers, and have put a lot of effort into drastically improving their submission based on all reviewers' comments. The weaknesses raised by the reviewers have been successfully addressed.  In particular, the reviewer (dm8f) who gave a score of 4 raised the following concerns:  1. There exist other time series anomaly detection datasets. 2. More anomaly detection methods should be considered in the experiments.  3. The finetune mode and distillation mode are not detailed, their pseudocodes should be provided.  The authors have addressed these concerns as follows:  1. In their answer, the authors went through an extensive list of existing benchmarks and justified why they are not appropriate to solve their focused problem, and how their dataset differ from those. The main added value of the proposed dataset is its timespan and the fact that its occurring distribution shifts are natural (as opposed to synthesized). 2. The authors have expanded their experiments with more anomaly detection models. The new results corroborate the previous conclusions. 3. The authors have added the pseudocode algorithm in Appendix and have added code to replicate their experiments in the git repository.  I believe that the authors have sufficiently addressed the reviewer's concerns (and more).  For these reasons, I recommend acceptance of the paper.
1	The paper proposes a new pipeline-parallel training method called WPipe. WPipe works (on a very high level) by replacing the two-buffer structure of PipeDream-2BW with a two-partition-group structure, allowing resources to be shared in a similar way to PipeDream-2BW but with less memory use and less delays in weight update propagation across stages. The 1.4x speedup it achieves over PipeDream-2BW is impressive.  In discussion, the reviewers agreed that the problem WPipe tries to tackle is important and that the approach is novel and interesting. But there was significant disagreement among the reviewers as to score. A reviewer expressed concern about the work being incremental and difficult to follow. And while these were valid concerns, and the authors should take note of them when revising their paper, I do not think they should present a bar to publication, both based on my own read of the work and also in light of the fact that other reviewers with higher confidence scores did not find novelty to be a disqualifying concern. As a result, I plan to follow the majority reviewer opinion and recommend acceptance here.
1	The paper introduces model-agnostic ways of quantifying predictive uncertainty and latent space differences in the situation when the distribution of data encountered during deployment differs from what the system was trained on and there is no access to the data itself. The model is evaluated on large scale EEG data.  The paper solves an important problem, in particular to the field of healthcare which has previously seen instances of models underperforming significantly at the time of deployment. As mentioned by the reviewers, this direction has not been sufficiently explored, so there is novelty in the problem itself, as well as in the solution. The experiments on EEG data were seen as convincing by the reviewers, though some questions were raised about the scope of the paper.  Overall, there is considerable merit in the work and recommend acceptance of this paper. In the camera ready, the authors should make sure not to overstate the applicability of their method. While this work could, in theory, be applied (or adapted) to other data, the merits of it outside of models trained on EEG data have not been demonstrated and should therefore not be stated as a given.  Reviewers x119 and PL6S have not engaged in the discussion although the authors responded to the issues they raised, which I kept in mind when issuing my recommendation.
1	The reviewer praises the creation of this potentially very valuable dataset and while there are some shortcomings in the presented benchmark/baseline results, I believe these will be quickly addressed by the community if the data becomes more widely used. MIDL aims to give some space for the presentation of open source data and I therefore also recommend acceptance.
0	The reviewers are in agreement that the paper should be rejected. Furthermore, the authors have declined to rebut the arguments of the reviewers. As such, I agree with the suggested rejection.
1	This paper considers the multi-fidelity variant of the best-arm identification problem. I recommend its acceptance and I strongly encourage the authors to take the several fantastic points raised by the reviewers while crafting their next draft. For instance, please include a discussion about (and clarification of) Assumption 1 that reflects the discussion with the reviewers.
1	This paper has proposed a method named zero-shot learning for attributes to deal with a research problem about novel attribute classification and attribute labeling. The reviewers have many questions in the intial round. After the rebuttal, the authours clarify most unclear points, and some reviewers raise the score. In general, all the reviewers agree with the acceptance of this paper.
1	This paper proposes a variant of stochastic gradient descent that parallelizes the algorithm for distributed training via delayed gradient averaging. While the algorithm (DaSGD) proposed is sensible and seems to work, it also seems to miss a lot of related work. As pointed out by one of the reviewers, the class of asynchronous decentralized methods already seem to cover the space of DaSGD, and it's not clear how DaSGD differs from the existing methods in this space. As a result of this lack of comparison to related work, the reviewers recommended that the paper not be accepted at this time, and this evaluation was not challenged by an author response. I agree with this consensus.
1	This paper presents some new results on near-optimum algorithms for distributed optimization, nearly matching lower bounds. Most of the reviewers are positive about the contributions of this work. However, one issue that came up is the assumption of bounded gradient dissimilarity, which is essentially a gap between upper and lower bounds. While I am recommending to accept this paper, I believe this gap should be more prominently discussed in the abstract and introduction.
1	The paper aims at controllable generation by introducing an additional "content-conditioner" block in the Transformer models. The paper further provides 4 different variants of a pre-training task to train the content-conditioner model.   While the proposed approach seems an incremental contribution over CTRL and PPLM, certain reviews praised the approach being novel while keeping the architecture changes minimal. Overall, reviews indicate that the overall proposed method of fine-grained controlled generation with self-supervision is valuable, and empirical results support its effectiveness.   All reviewers initially raised concerns regarding clarity and lack of human evaluation. However, clarity issues seem to be resolved through author/reviewer discussions and the updated revision.  R3 had important concerns regarding topic and sentiment relevance evaluations.   While the reviewer remains unconvinced after discussions with authors, after carefully reading the revised paper and discussions, I feel that the authors tried to address this point fairly  through their additional experiments and also edited their contribution statement accordingly.  Overall, at least two reviewers sounded very excited about this work and other than R3's concerns, the general sentiment about this work was positive. Therefore, I recommend weak accept.    There are still some writing issues that I strongly encourage authors to carefully address in the future versions. Quoting from reviewer discussions:  > Differentiability of the adversarial loss. Authors just added one statement saying " Through continuous approximation.." without any more details are given, which continuous approx was used (Gumbel softmax?) and how they overcame the problem of its training instability.   > Table 6, can be misleading, authors bold the results when cocon+ is performing better than baselines (mostly in content similarity) but not the other way around topic/sentiment accuracy. The latter is arguably more important.
1	The paper presents a multi-granularity input represenaion and a pyramid attention mechanism for code summarizaiton tasks. After extensive discussion, the reviewers still cannot agree on accepting or rejecting this paper. The key discussion points and my opinion are summarized in below.    1. Performance improvement -- a few reviewers point out the performance improvement is relatively small (about 1%) compared with baseline. With the additional error bar provided by the authors, it seems to me the improvement is statistically significant. The authors also provide sufficient ablation study to justify the improvement. Although it's arguable if the proposed appracoh is substantial, the progress of AI is often driven by incremental improvement in terms of performance. Therefore, I'm less concerned by this issue.   2. Comparison only on 1 language and 2 datasets. I partially agree with the authors and reviwers Xtyo that the paper already conducted extensive experiments and the merits of the proposed approach are justified. However, I disagree with the attritue that the comparison on 1 language is sufficient given the recent progress of code summariziton. As the proposed approach is mainly justified by empirical comparison, conducting results on a limited dataset raises the concern whether the proposed approach is generalizble to other languages and datasets. It also makes future work harder to compare with this work. I especially disagree the point that some earlier papers only compared on limited datasets. These papers are published earlier than the benchmark CodeXGlue has been released. As most recent baselines are compared on CodeXGlue, there is a need to justify the missing of results on this dataset. Besides, the argument of the dataet is noisy the performance is low do not seem rigorous and reasonable to me.  3. Human evaluation. The authors provide a preliminary study of human evaluation on the generated outputs. On one hand, it shows the proposed approach indeed improve the quality of the summary, but on the other hand, the study requires more rigorous design. I would suggest including the human evaluation on the main text rather than in appendix.   4. Presentation. The paper is mostly well-written and provide nice intuition behind the propose method. However, I also agree with Q2Zz that some statements might overclaim and require justification. The later part of the paper has significant number of typos and require a careful proofread. It's pity that the authors do not take the opportunity during the rebuttal period to revise the paper.  Overall, I think the paper has sufficient merits but still have room to improve.
1	The authors analyze the latent representation of visual features from natural movies in the salamander retina using a U-net. They train an encoder to learn a compressed latent representation from a large population of salamander retinal ganglion cells responding to natural movies, while a decoder samples from this compressed latent space to generate the appropriate movie frame. They characterize its representation of “time in the natural scene” in the latent space of their model.  Overall, the reviewers expressed a lot of interest in the topic and valued the novel application to salamander retinal data. There were some questions about the significance of the finding, and through the rebuttal period, the authors provided a number of experiments to compare against other variants of their baselines (and ablations), with some reviewers increasing their scores in favor of acceptance.   At the same time, there was concern that the U-Net architecture could potentially reconstruct the movie without any retinal data. Thus, it was not entirely clear whether the model was truly leveraging the retinal data to obtain meaningful outputs. Unfortunately, this concern was not fully addressed in the revision, leaving the reviewers overall with mixed views but the majority in favor of acceptance.
1	This paper studies a learning scenario in which there exist 2 classes of examples: "predictable" and "noise". Learning theory is provided for this setting and a novel algorithm is devised that identifies predictable examples and makes predictions at the same time. A more practical algorithm is devised as well. Results are supported by experiments.  Reviewers have raised a number of concerns (ranging from how realistic this settings is to missing references). Overall they found this work interesting and relevant to ML community and appreciate the effort that authors have put in in their thoughtful response. However, after a thorough deliberation conference program committee decided that the paper is not sufficiently strong in its current form to be accepted.
1	The paper gives an extension of the transformer model that is suited to computing representations of source code. The main difference from transformers is that the model takes in a program's abstract syntax tree (AST) in addition to its sequence representation, and utilizes several pairwise distance measures between AST nodes in the self-attention operation. The model is evaluated on the task of code summarization for 5 different languages and shown to beat two state-of-the-art models. One interesting observation is that a model trained on data from all languages outperforms the monolingual version of the model.  The reviewers generally liked the paper. The technical idea is simple, but the evaluation is substantial and makes a convincing case about setting a new state of the art. The observation about multilingual models is also interesting. While there were a few concerns, many of these were addressed in the authors' responses, and the ones that remain seem minor. Given this, I am recommending acceptance as a poster. Please incorporate the reviewers' comments in the final version.
1	In this paper, the authors tackle the problem of demonstrators and learners having different observation spaces, by proposing an importance-weighted learning algorithm to bring the support of the imitator state marginal closer to that of the expert demonstrator's state marginal.   All reviewers have voted to weak accept, but it would seem that this year's NeurIPS mechanism of reviewer assignment has resulted in a much higher acceptance rate than typical, with 80%+ of the AC batch having accept votes. As such, I am tasked with the tough job of rejecting some papers that reviewers were only lukewarmly excited about. It pains me to do this to a paper that reviewers have found methodologically correct. I will be recommending this paper be rejected based on calibration against other papers I'm AC'ing, mostly for the following reason:  The HOIL paper assumes a problem setting where:  1. expert observations with more privilege observations than learner:  2. access to expert observations being high cost and invasive  3. importance-weighting the data to close the support between learner and expert state distributions mitigates (1) and (2)  However, it's not demonstrated that (1) and (2) is an actual problem in practical applications. Is sensor mismatch between human and autonomous vehicles the actual problem for learning? Do self-driving cars even utilize a policy formulation explored in the HOIL paper? How big are these state / support mismatches in practice, and couldn't they be mitigated by simpler methods? This paper is the first I've heard suggested that sensor mismatch between humans and autonomous vehicle sensors is the bottleneck for performance. If we remove this motivation from the paper and only consider the importance weighting algorithm used for removing out of distribution examples, then it doesn't feel quite as novel as there are many works that propose some kind of distribution-projection step as a way to mitigate state marginal differences between teachers and learners (e.g. CQL).   In fact, the setting (1) is not only avoided, but actively exploited by some learning papers (Asymmetric Actor Critic, Guided Policy Search, and other ideas) to *boost* the sample efficiency of learning, with the idea that the asymmetry in state support allows experts to provide useful learning signal in a way that the learner cannot adversarially overfit easily.   From reviewer pD56,  ``` I didn't find the authors' response to be particularly convincing (the self-driving example doesn't seem like a good fit for what they're doing, and I think they're conflating differences in perceptual accuracy with differences in sensing hardware). ```
1	This paper was reviewed by 4 reviewers who scored the paper below acceptance threshold even after the rebuttal. Reviewer 4 is concerned about motivation, Reviewer 2 rightly points out that there exist numerous works that use some form of spectral layers in a deep setting on challenging datasets - something lacking in this work. Reviewer 3 is concerned about limited discussion on lie groups and the overall benefit of expm(.). Reviewer 1 reverberates the same comments regarding insufficient experiments,  comparisons and limited motivation. We encourage authors to consider all pointers given by reviewers in any future re-submission.
1	The reviewers are in agreement that this is a well-motivated paper and should be accepted. As R1 mentioned, the contribution does not lie in a novel visualization but rather in the process, insights, and patterns learned during the design and evaluation process.   The reviewers also agreed that the design implications section lacked depth. This is the one area where the paper has the biggest scope of improving. The reviewers have offered suggestions for different approaches to addressing this shortcoming.   Some other comments worth highlighting: R1 has raised some concerns regarding how the 5 questions were selection and would like added details regarding the process.  R2 would like some discussion around the prior approach or set-up that this system replaced.  R3 has provided detailed feedback on minor changes which will improve the overall readability of the paper and can be accomplished prior to the camera ready submission.
0	## Description The paper discovers interesting phenomena in training neural networks with binary weights: - Connection between latent weight magnitude and how important its binarized version for the network performance -training dynamics, indicating that large latent weights are identified and stabilize early on - Observation that amongst learned binary kernel, several specific patterns prevail, up to the bits who's reversal has very little effect. This is so regardless of the architecture, the layer considered or the dataset.  The paper further demonstrates how these observations may be used to compress binary neural networks below 1 bit per weight.  ## Review Process and Decision The reviewers welcomed the experimental investigation of new phenomena, but commented the overall technical quality of the work as somewhat substandard. The redundancy of consecutive affine transforms is known and not connected to binary weights investigation. The investigation itself lacks a more in-depth analysis. The proposed compression results appeared not convincing to reviewers since a significant drop of accuracy occurs. The AC shares these concerns and supports rejection.  ## General Comments From my perspective, the study undertaken is methodologically „wrong“. An ad-hoc training method is investigated, which is not even clearly defined in the paper (there are many „STE“ variants) and for which it is not known what it is doing, what are the real-valued weights for and whether they are needed at all (as empirically argued by Helwegen et al. (2019)). As such, the investigation makes impression of poking a black box (the training method in this case). At the same time, there are more clear learning formulations, applicable in the setting of the paper (binary weights), in particular considering the stochastic relaxation: * Shayer et al. (2017): Learning Discrete Weights Using the Local Reparameterization Trick * Roth et al. (2019): Training Discrete-Valued Neural Networks with Sign Activations Using Weight Distributions * Peters et al. (2018): Probabilistic binary neural networks  These methods are approximate, but at least the optimization is well posed and it is known what do the real-valued weights represent (e.g. logits of binary weight probabilities). From this perspective, it can be seen that latent weights close to 0 correspond to Bernoulli weights that are almost fully random (and thus only contribute noise) and are fragile to gradient steps. Therefore the model can only perform well if it learns to be robust to their state or their state becomes more deterministic (corresponding to large latent weight). So one would actually expect to see in these models phenomena similar to the observed in the paper and not bee too much surprised or astonished by them. Furthermore, there are recent works explaining STE and its latent weights as optimizing the stochastic relaxation: * Meng et al. (2020): Training Binary Neural Networks using the Bayesian Learning Rule * Yanush et al. (2020): Reintroducing Straight-Through Estimators as Principled Methods for Stochastic Binary Networks.   The authors are encouraged to make the observed phenomena more explainable by connecting to the mentioned works.  ## Further Details  *  „We show that in the context of using batch normalization after convolutional layers, adapting scaling factors with either hand-crafted or learnable methods brings marginal or no accuracy gain to final model.“  From theoretical perspective, this is obvious and known to me. Practically, there could be in principle some difference due to the learning dynamics, and verifying that there is none is a useful but a weak contribution. The section devoted to this issue can be given in the appendix but is not justified in the main paper.  * „change of weight signs is crucial in the training of BWNs“  The sign determines the binary weights, so this is by definition.  * „ Firstly, the training of BWNs demonstrates the process of seeking primary binary sub-networks whose weight signs are determined and fixed at the early training stage, which is akin to recent findings on the lottery ticket hypothesis for efficient learning of sparse neural networks“  In the lottery ticket hypothesis paper it is shown explicitly that the identified sparse subnetwork changes during the learning the most rather than retains its initialization state or the state in the beginning of the training. It is therefore could be of a different nature.
1	This paper demonstrates that deep networks can memorize adversarial examples of training data with completely random labels, which motivates some analyses on the convergence and generalization of adversarial training (AT). The authors identify a significant drawback of memorization in AT that could result in robust overfitting and propose a new algorithm to mitigate this drawback. Experiments on benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. One of the reviewers is concerned about (1) the validity of stability analysis where 80% of the data labels are noisy, and the perturbation (64/255) is large, (2) the gap between theory and practice, and (3) novelty. The authors have made a great effort to address these concerns. Although there is still no consensus after the author's response, the majority of the reviewers are in strong support. I, therefore, recommend acceptance.
1	This submission proposes a method for learning convolutional filters with trainable size, that builds on top of multiplicative filter networks.  Anti-aliasing is achieved by parametrization with anisotropic Gabor filters.  The reviewers were unanimous in their opinion that the paper is suitable for acceptance to ICLR.  The authors are encouraged to make use of the extensive reviewer discussion in improving the final version of the paper.
1	This paper proposes a differentiable meta-solver applicable to large-scale combinatorial optimization. After a thorough discussion phase, all the reviewers are on the positive side of this paper. The reviewers appreciated the novelty of this paper and the importance of scaling neural combinatorial optimization for large-scale instances. Overall, I recommend acceptance for this paper.  However, the reviewers also showed concerns about the presentation of this paper. The gap between generalization and testing performance is not clearly discussed and the connection to prior works using continuous latent space should be clearly stated. Since scalability is an important issue, it would be useful to clear up time/objective comparison and unify experimental settings as suggested by Reviewer fQdp and fe3B.
1	The paper contains interesting ideas and fits well within MIDL's short paper scope of also providing a live discussion space for accepted journal publications. Given that unfortunately only one reviewer was available, whose weak reject is mostly based on formatting, I believe that the paper can still be accepted. However, I strongly urge the authors to reformat their paper to be consistent with the MIDL style when preparing the camera-ready version.
0	This paper proposes improving human interpretability and manipulability of neural representations by obtaining syntactic roles (here, subject, object, prepositional object, and main verb) without supervision by means of them becoming linked to latent variables in a novel proposed attention-driven VAE (ADVAE) model, which provides cross attention between a language transformer and latent variables. The paper argues that syntactic roles are quite central to meaning interpretation and that the ADVAE recovers them better than LSTM or Transformer (with mean pooling) VAEs.  This is a quite interesting direction and paper. There was active discussion with the reviewers, one of whom (9pDc) moved their rating from reject to quite strong support, while the other reviewers either sat on the fence or raised from reject to borderline. Nevertheless, I overall tend to agree that the paper is still lacking in empirical support, a view clearly shared by reviewers WuPD and 7uFL. The SNLI data is very simple descriptive sentences, nearly all in the form of S V O or S V PP. Would this work on more complex data, in other languages, or with more word order variation? There isn't very much investigation, but the new results added during reviewing based on Yelp data seem to offer more concerns than confidence. These are also very short sentences but with more varied structure and some complementation. It seems like D_{dec} is now very low (much lower than for the sequence VAE), the ability to distinguish out grammatical roles seems limited to {subj} vs. {dobj, pobj} in the encoder and none at all in the decoder (Figure 6/7). And then for the examples in Appendix D, the disentanglement abilities barely seem stronger than being able to pick out subjects, though when there are sentences with subordinate clauses, it is perhaps random which subject you get. The resampled realizations in appendix H also seem to show limited disentanglement: resampling the subject usually seems to change the object as well, often markedly. No convincing downstream applications are shown. As such, while I agree that disentanglement is at the heart of representation learning, I can't get on board with reviewer 9pDc feeling that this paper now has convincing results. Reviewer 7uFL also emphasizes that there is no strong reason that the latent variables have to align with syntactic roles. In particular, the motivation in NMT whereby constituents clump and reorder together does not exist here. It may only work for the very simple and regular sentences of SNLI.  Hence, overall, I feel that this method needs more extensive validation on harder, more varied data sets before it becomes a convincing contribution, and so I propose rejecting the paper at this point in time. Nevertheless, I do think the topic is interesting and this approach has the potential to be good.
1	The paper studies the behavior cloning based strategies of offline RL algorithms in different type of environments and reports that performance primarily depends on model size and regularization. The results contradict some of the earlier claims, and the authors conjecture that model size and regularization characteristics can explain past results.    During the review period, the reviewers agreed that the paper has certain merits, and on the other hand, they also raised some concerns, regarding some missing technical details, whether the empirical finding could be trusted, the generalization of the findings to more scenarios, and the comparison with some highly related papers. The authors did a good job in their rebuttal, which removed many of the above concerns (although not all) and convinced the reviewers to raise their scores. As a result, we believe it is fine to accept the paper (although somehow like a weak accept).
0	The reviewers agree that the idea of introducing structural biases in the attention mechanism is interesting but the results and presentation right now is not convincing. Improvements are seen on only some datasets and the comparisons are not exact. A reject.
1	Most reviewers were positive about the paper, seeing that the proposed method is practical and has convincing experimental performances. One reviewer was a bit negative and raised questions about clarity. After the authors responded, the negative reviewer didn't respond further. After reviewing all the comments, the AC feels that there is enough support from reviewers to accept this paper.
0	All reviewers agree that the writing is not precise. It does not help to find any novelty in the ideas, and the limited and too quickly described experiences are not convincing enough to forgive this problem. The authors chose not to oppose or comment on the detailed arguments provided by the reviewers. I agree with the reviewers in recommending the rejection of this paper.
1	This paper presents a new task and model for predicting the hierarchical structure of organizations / institutes. The model predicts is-ancestor relationships between the institutions by modeling the set operations between the strings. The authors develop a new dataset, automatically derived from GRID, and compare their set-based model against a few baseline approaches.   The reviewers’ comments were generally positive and praised the usefulness of the task, which makes us recommend acceptance. However, there were some concerns about the experimental setup (choice of baselines and evaluation).   We strongly recommend improving these aspects on the final version, as per the reviewers’ suggestions.
1	The paper proposes a new algorithm for dataset distillation, based on two key ideas:  (1) train a linear layer given the fixed feature extractor, and (2) use a diverse set of modes as feature extractors. The paper has received overwhelmingly positive reviews. Many reviewers find the algorithm effective, the paper well-written, and the results compelling. The rebuttal further addressed the concerns regarding the backbone models and missing experiments as well as provided additional clarifications. The AC agreed with the reviewers’ consensus and recommended accepting the paper.
1	The submission received split reviews: two reviewers recommended weak accepts, and the other two weak rejects.  The AC went through the reviews, responses, and discussions carefully.  The AC agrees that this paper is well-written and has demonstrated the possibility of using transformers for particle-based physical simulation.  The AC also believes that the authors have addressed the concerns of reviewer dYcg, despite that the reviewer didn't engage in the discussions.  The contributions are however not most exciting, and none of the reviewers would like to champion the submission.  Further, the AC agrees with the knowledgeable and responsible reviewer ZsKn that the presentation and experiments can be better positioned to highlight the key contribution. As reviewer ZsKn has summarized, it's recommended that "the authors took the approach of integrating the different parts of the newly proposed layer into existing architectures (possibly including non-simulation settings), and try to understand better that way how the new layer may help in a more apples-to-apples comparison."  The recommendation is reject, and the authors are encouraged to revise the paper for the next venue.
1	This paper proposes a model for learning using ensemble clustering. The reviewers found the general idea promising. However, while promising, all reviewers noted that in its curent form the paper is not fit for publication. The reviewers pointed out missing references, issues with the abstract, lack of motivation for some of the algorithmic choices, limited novelty over clarity in the description of difference w.r.t. previous work. Because of all these reasons, this paper does not meet the bar of acceptance. I recommend the authors take into account the feedback provided in the reviews and discussion and resubmit to another venue.
1	The authors show how to perfectly sample a discrete distribution, given sample access to the Bradley-Terry-Luce model on subsets of size 2. While the learning problem has been previously studied extensively, this work initiates the study of sampling. Technically, the authors introduce re-weighting and rejection sampling ideas that speed up coupling from the past by utilizing an approximate learning algorithm; these techniques could be useful in other applications, as the authors hint in the rebuttal.  The reviewers agreed that the paper is technically quite strong and that it's quite well written. The authors responded to all remaining questions by the reviewers, clearing the path to the paper being accepted.
1	This is a very high-quality dataset, which is especially noteworthy since legal NLP benchmarks are very difficult to build. The authors approached every aspect of the process with extreme care. It will likely have an impact on law practice and start interesting discussions about the use of ML in these settings. The paper is also very well written and enjoyable to read.  Most reviewers are heavily in favor of acceptance. Reviewer Aeqk brought up some weaknesses, but at least from the AC's perspective, these seem to be answered well by the authors.
1	### Paper summary  This paper investigates theoretically and empirically the effect of increasing the number of parameters ("overparameterization") in GAN training. By analogy to what happens in supervised learning with neural networks, overparameterization does help to stabilize the training dynamics (and improve performance empirically). This paper provides an explicit threshold for the width of a 1-layer ReLU network generator so that gradient-ascent training with a linear discriminator yields a linear rate of convergence to the global saddle point (which corresponds to the empirical mean of the generator matching the mean of the data). The authors also provides a more general theorem that generalizes this result to deeper networks.  ### Evaluation The reviewers had several questions and concerns which were well addressed in the rebuttal and following discussion, in particular in terms of clarifying the meaning of "overparameterization". After discussing the paper, R1, R2 and R4 recommend acceptance while R3 recommends rejection. The main concern of R3 is that the GAN formulation analyzed in the paper is mainly doing moment matching between the generator  distribution (produced from a *fixed* set of latent variables z_i) and the empirical mean of the data. R3 argues that this is not sufficient to "understanding the training of GANs". At least two aspects are missing: how the distribution induced by the generator converges according to other notion of divergence (like KL, Wasserstein, etc.); and what about the true generator distribution (not just its empirical version from a fixed finite set of samples z_i)? While agreeing these are problematic, the other reviewers judged that the manuscript was useful first step in understanding the role of overparameterization in GANs and thus still recommend acceptance. And importantly, this paper is the first to study this question theoretically.  I also read the paper in more details. I have a feeling that some aspects of this work were already developed in the supervised learning literature; but the gradient descent-ascent dynamic aspect appears novel to me and the important question of the role of overparameterization here is both timely, novel and quite interesting. I side with R1, R2 and R4: this paper is an interesting first step, and thus I recommend acceptance. See below for additional comments to be taken in consideration for the camera ready version.  ### Some detailed comments - Beginning of section 2.3: please be clearer early on that you will keep V fixed to a random initialization rather than learning it. The fact that this is standard in some other papers is not a reason to not be clear about it. - Theorem 2.2: in the closed form of the objective when $d$ is explicitly optimized, we are back to a more standard supervised learning formulation, for example (5) could look like regression. The authors should be more clear about this, and also mention in the main text that the core technical part used to prove Theorem 2.2 is from Oymak & Soltanolkotabi 2020 (which considers supervised learning). This should also a bit more clear in the introduction -- it seems to me that the main novelty of the work is to look at the gradient-descent dynamic, which is a bit different than the supervised learning setup, even though some parts are quite related (like the full maximization with respect to $d$). - p.6 equation (8): typo -- the  $-\mu d_t$ term is redundant and should be removed as already included from $\nabla_d h(d,\theta)$. - p.7 "numerical validations" paragraph: Please describe more clearly what is the meaning of "final MSE". Is this a global saddle point (and thus shows the limit of the generator to match the empirical mean), or is this coming from slowness of convergence of the method (e.g. after a fixed number of iterations, or according to some stopping criterion?). Please clarify.
1	The reviewers are in agreement that this paper provides a minimax optimal solution to the problem of offline linear contextual bandits. This new family of learning rules beat state of the art approaches and provide a unified view on existing approaches, such as Lower Confidence Bound and Bellman-Consistent Pessimism. The theoretical results are backed by reasonable numerical simulations. Accept.
1	Summary: This paper provides an interesting and unique challenge problem on human-AI collaboration, with sample baselines. I think this is an extremely important topic and the community should embrace such challenge problems.  Discussion: Reviewers agreed this paper should be accepted, particularly after seeing that ICLR has accepted such challenge papers in the past.  Recommendation: I'd really like to see this get a spotlight as it would be great to highlight this innovative challenge to the community.
1	This paper introduces sparse modeling-inspired regularizations to improve deep neural network-based image generators. Experimental results on both (low-resolution) image synthesis and deep image prior-based inverse problems are used to validate the proposed method. The majority of the reviewers were against the acceptance of the paper. As summarized by Reviewer tsoA: "There are shortcomings in the overall concept as well as its evaluation. The findings suggest that this might be a promising avenue of research, but it would need to be taken further. At present, the paper boils down too much into simply adding a simple regularizer at the end and observing that it somewhat improves some metrics in a limited number of scenarios. Due to the limitations of the evaluation, it remains unclear whether the proposed improvement carries over to state of the art models and datasets. Similarly, the promised elucidation of the purpose of the feature values never really materializes." The AC agrees with that summarization and recommends rejection.
1	There are contrasting review rating ranging from 9 to 3. The reasonable concerns about this paper not been well validated for ML community. The proposed datasets has been benchmarked with some classical and some relevant DL methods. I have taken into account the expertise of reviewers and their concerns carefully. I do agree with some reviewers opinion about this dataset will be importance to medical CV community. I do agree with authors response "The open questions for the ML community that OpenSRH may foster innovative discoveries include the following: 1) domain adaptation between SRH images and other histology images such as H&E images in the large scale TCGA project; 2) using multiple instance learning (MIL) to avoid expensive dense patch annotations; 3) different aggregation methods for patch-based training, including clustering, attention, or MIL; 4) self supervised learning and comparing different augmentation strategies for SRH images; and 5) data efficient training of ViT architectures using SRH data. " Even though the authors have not verified these innovative applications on the openSRH dataset. I will go with acceptance opinion of few reviewers for this paper.
0	The review highlights numerous problems with the current progress of the work. While MIDL encourages early submission of ongoing research as short paper, this work is not mature enough for publication. I therefore recommend rejection.
1	The paper presents a new Bayesian optimization method based on the Gaussian process bandits framework for black-box adversarial attacks. The method achieves good performance in the experiments, which was appreciated by all the reviewers.  At the same time, the presentation of the method is quite confusing, which currently precludes acceptance of the paper. In particular, during the discussion phase the reviewers were not able to decipher the algorithm based on the description presented in the paper. It is not clear how the problem is modeled as a bandit problem, what the loss function $\ell$ is minimized and why minimizing it makes sense (assuming, e.g., that $\ell$ it the hinge loss as suggested and the initial prediction is good with a large margin, that is, the loss is zero, equation 6 never changes $x_t$ when the procedure is started from $x$). This connection, since it is the fundamental contribution of the paper, should be much better explained. Once the problem is set up to estimate (maximize?) the reward, it is changed to calculating the difference in the minimization (cf. equation 11), which is again unmotivated. (Other standard aspects of the algorithm should also be explained properly, e.g., the stopping condition of Algorithm 1)  Unfortunately, the paper is written in a mathematically very imprecise manner. As an example, consider equation (6), where $B_p$ and the projection operator are not defined, and while these can be guessed, a projection of the argmin seems to be missing as well in the end (otherwise nothing guarantees that $x_T$, which is the final outcome of the algorithm, remains in the $L_p$ ball). Another example is the $Discrete\ Approximate\ CorrAttack_{Flip}$ paragraph which requires that every coordinate of $x$ should be changed by  $\pm\epsilon$. It is also not clear what "dividing the image into several blocks" means in Section 4.1 (e.g., are these overlapping, do they cover the whole image, etc., not to mention that previously $x$ was a general input, not necessarily an image). It is also unlikely that the stopping condition in Algorithm 1 would use the exact same $\epsilon$ for the acquisition function as the perturbation radius for adversarial examples, etc. While some of these inaccuracies and unclear definitions are also mentioned in the reviews, unfortunately there are more in the paper.  The authors are encouraged to resubmit the paper to the next venue after significantly improving and cleaning up the presentation.
1	The paper provides new techniques (algorithmic as well as analytical) to solve black box optimization of smooth functions with constraints. The reviewers are largely in favor of the paper's contributions, and the author responses have helped to clarify several aspects of the presentation and connections to existing work. Therefore, I recommend that the paper be accepted.
0	This submission describes an approach to compressing the communication in federated learning. The key idea is using a set of random samples from a prior distribution and then performing importance weighed sampling. The work performs an analysis of the privacy guarantees of this process and experimental evaluation. The main issue with this work is the authors appear to be unaware that the basic problem they pose is solved in a more comprehensive and lossless way in a recent work https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.12099 (Feldman and Talwar, ICML 2021). That work shows that any differentially private randomizer can be compressed via a simpler algorithm that performs rejection sampling using a PRG. The algorithm does not loose privacy or utility (under standard cryptographic assumptions) while guaranteeing low communication. In contrast this work loses significantly in utility and provides opaque privacy guarantees. This submission analyzes  a randomized that adds Gaussian distribution and, in particular, the compression technique in (Feldman and Talwar) applies to it. The technique proposed in this work is very similar in spirit (with prior distribution corresponding to reference distribution in the earlier work. In light of the earlier work I do not think the contributions in this submission are sufficient for publication.
1	The submission receives 5 reviews form 5 reviewers and all are positive about the proposed dataset presented in the submission. AC reads all reviews and discussions and agree with the reviewers. AC recommends to accept the submission as a spotlight.
1	Most prior works on neural kernels have focused on using the ReLU activation. In this work, the authors provide new methods that can approximate multi-layered Neural Network Gaussian Process (NNGP) kernels and Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) matrices for a wide range of activation functions. All the four reviewers recommended acceptance of the paper.
1	Meta Review: This paper studies the problem of top-K recovery from a fixed set of queries. In each query, the user is presented m items and they select the item with the highest noisy utility. The authors propose a simple solution to this problem, take top-K most frequently chosen items, and prove that it is near optimal. The proposed solution is simple and valid only under strong assumptions, the utility of the query is additive in its items and the item utility noise is independent. Nevertheless, the problem is studied in depth, including a lower bound and comparison to model-based approaches to solving the problem. All reviewers liked the paper and I support acceptance.
1	This paper proposes a unified model-based framework for high-level skill learning and composition through hierarchical RL. The proposed approach combines high-level planning in a low dimensional space with low-level skill learning, where each low-level skill is a policy conditioned on the high-level task. The low-level policies are learned by using a mutual information objective. The proposed approach is evaluated on locomotion tasks, and is shown to be overall more data efficient than alternative baselines. The reviewers agree that this work is original and sufficiently empirically motivated for acceptance. Two reviewers were concerned by the experimental setup and the transfer setting that are somehow too simple, but the authors fixed these issues in the improved version based on the feedback.
1	The paper proposes a comprehensive benchmark for program understanding and generation consisting of 10 tasks across 14 datasets. All the reviewers agree that this dataset has potentially be used as a standard benchmark to measure progress in this domain. Therefore, I recommend acceptance of this paper.
1	This paper describes a clever new class of piecewise-linear RNNs that contains a long-time scale memory subsystem. The reviewers found the paper interesting and valuable, and I agree. The four submitted reviews were unanimous in their vote to accept. The theoretical insights and empirical results are impactful and would be suitable for spotlight presentation.
1	The reviewers unanimously acknowledge the clarity of the paper and the relevance of the theoretical contribution. One weakness pointed out by reviewers is the limited experimental evaluation. Overall, this constitutes a good theoretical contribution at the intersection of causal representation learning and nonlinear ICA, which we recommend for acceptance.
1	While all reviewers agree that the topic is interesting and the work has merit, several issues have been pointed out, especially by R1 and R3, that indicate that the work is not  ready for acceptance at this stage. the authors are strongly encouraged to continue to work on this topic, taking into account the feedback received.
1	the reviewer's opinion was split on this paper, but after rebuttal no major concerns remained so I recommend acceptance. However, the authors should aim to incorporate the answers given to the reviewers concerns in the final version.
1	The authors design an algorithm for composite stochastic optimization that leverages both smoothness and strong convexity with respect to the same (general) norm, using a stochastic counterpart to recent work by Diakonikolas and Guzman. They then show how to leverage this algorithm and randomized smoothing in order to create an algorithm for constrained smooth convex optimization based on exact gradient evaluations and linear optimization computations. Compared to Frank-Wolfe, the algorithm requires strictly less gradient evaluations and parallelizes the same amount of linear optimization computations.  The paper received generally favorable reviews, with the exception of reviewer 3QVT who did not engage in discussion and whose critique I found unclear. I agree with reviewer rQnJ’s assessment that even though “all the building block are quite known in optimization community (accelerated methods, duality, Bregman distances, smoothing, etc.), the whole approach fits perfectly together and provides the reader with a number of nice and useful observations.” Consequently, I recommend acceptance.
1	This paper received unanimous recommendations of acceptance from the reviewer. The authors did a good job addressing concerns from the reviewers, especially with the additional ablation studies to decouple the gains from other techniques such as SupCon. The AC agrees with the reviewers regarding the contribution of this paper and recommends acceptance.
1	All reviewers found interest and merit in this paper, some negative points were satisfactorily addressed by authors. The paper should be accepted.
1	This paper develops a smoothing procedure to avoid the problem of posterior collapse in VAEs. The method is interesting and novel, the experiments are well executed, and the authors answered satisfactorily to most of the reviewers' concerns. However, there is one remaining issue that would require additional discussion. As identified by Reviewer 1, the analysis in Section 3 is only valid when the number of layers is 2. Above that value, "it is possible to construct models where the ELBO has a reasonable value, but the smoothed objective behaves catastrophically". Thus, the scope of the analysis in Section 3 deserves further discussion. Given the large number of ICLR submissions, this paper unfortunately does not meet the acceptance bar. That said, I encourage the authors to address this point and resubmit the paper to another (or the same) venue.
1	The paper is concerned with learning transformation equivariant node representation of graph data in an unsupervised setting. The paper extends prior work in this topic by focusing on equivariance under topology transformations (adding/removing edges) and considering an information theoretic perspective. Reviewers highlighted the promising ideas of the approach, its relevance for the ICLR community, and the promising experimental results (although improvements over prior work are not necessarily significant on all benchmarks).  However, reviewers raised concerns regarding the novelty of the method and the clarity of presentation with respect to key parts of the method. These aspects connect also to further concerns raised, e.g., related to mathematical correctness as well as the significance of the proposed loss function, the benefits of motivating it from MI, and the improvements over GraphTER. The rebuttal didn't fully clarify these points. While the paper is mostly solid, I agree with the reviewers' concerns and -- currently -- the paper doesn't clear the bar for acceptance; it would require another revision to improve upon these points. However, I'd encourage the authors to revise and resubmit their work with considering this feedback.
0	This paper introduces Regioned Episodic Reinforcement Learning (RERL), which partitions the state space by generating a diverse set of goals and then explores the state space by learning policies that reach those goals. This idea is a combination of episodic memory techniques and “goal-oriented” reinforcement learning.   After the authors’ responses and the discussion phase, all reviewers converged to recommending the rejection of this paper. The main concerns regarding this paper are:  * Presentation. The proposed approach is not that well justified, some of the claims in the paper are quite imprecise, and there’s relevant related work missing. * Evaluation. The evaluation sometimes feels rushed and is not held in a diverse enough set of tasks, not capturing important properties one would want to capture.  I recommend the authors to pay close attention to presentation, as well as the experiments and analysis in order to make the paper stronger.
1	This paper performs an empirical comparison of similarity-based attribution methods, which aim to "explain" model predictions via training samples. To this end, the authors propose a handful of metrics intended to measure the acceptability of such methods. While one reviewer took issue with the proposed criteria, the general consensus amongst reviewers is that this provides at least a start for measuring and comparing instance-attribution methods.   In sum, this is a worthwhile contribution to the interpretability literature that provides measures for comparing and contrasting explanation-by-training-example methods.
1	This paper presents a new CLIP-driven stylization method given an input mesh and text description. Compared to previous works Text2Mesh, the paper introduces a more expressive rendering model based on learnable SVBRDF and normal maps. Many reviewers found the paper easy to follow, the idea promising, and the results visually appealing. They also expressed their concerns regarding the similarity to Text2Mesh, the limitations of the normal maps approach (compared to changing geometry explicitly), and the relighting and material editing of the stylized object. The rebuttal has addressed most of the concerns. The AC agreed with most of the reviewers and recommended accepting the paper.   Please revise the papers according to the reviewer’s comments: (1) change the title according to Reviewer kpuS, (2) add relighting/material editing/view synthesis results, and (3) highlight the pros and cons of the proposed method w.r.t. Text2Mesh.
1	This paper proposes a new gradient-based attribution method Distilled Gradient Aggregation (DGA), which combines the strengths of both local and global attribution methods. The reviewers and meta-reviewer found the method novel, and supported by promising results both qualitatively and quantitatively.   During the rebuttal phase, the authors made a _thorough_ effort in response to each reviewer's comments. As recognized by two reviewers (hnze, cvDy), the newly added results and discussions have significantly strengthened the contribution.   The AC recommends acceptance given the paper tackles a critical problem, and presented an effective and convincing method that advances the field of explainable AI.   Authors are strongly recommended to include these new results and writing changes suggested by the reviewers for the final version of the manuscript.
1	This paper presents U-WILDS, an extension of the multi-task, large-scale domain-shift dataset WILDS. The authors propose an extensive array of experiments evaluating the ability of a wide variety of algorithms to leverage the unlabelled data to address domain-shift problems. The vision behind sounds quite ambitious and convincing to me, namely, the proposed U-WILDS benchmark would be a useful and well-motivated resource for the ML community, and their experiments were very comprehensive. Although they did not introduce any new methods in this paper, U-WILDS significantly expands the range of modalities, applications, and shifts available for studying and benchmarking real-world unsupervised adaptation.  The clarity, vision and significance are clearly above the bar of ICLR. While the reviewers had some concerns on the novelty, the authors did a particularly good job in their rebuttal. Thus, all of us have agreed to strongly accept this paper for publication! Please include the additional rebuttal discussion in the next version.
0	This paper presents work on semantic action-conditioned video prediction.  The reviewers appreciated the interesting task and use of capsule networks to address it.  Concerns were raised over generalization ability of the proposed approach, points on clarity, scalability, and handling of uncertainty/diversity by the method.  After reading the authors' response, the reviewers engaged in discussion.  Over the course of this discussion, the reviewers converged on a reject rating, noting that the concerns raised above were not sufficiently addressed to warrant publication at this stage.
1	The submission describes a new method to avoid the shortcut learning behaviour in DNNs. After the rebuttal and discussion, most of the reviewers are positive about this submission since the proposed method does not require prior knowledge about the dataset and the strong empirical results for the debasing task. On the negative results, the reviewers argue that the experimental evaluation is not thorough enough. Overall, AC recommends acceptance but asks the authors to perform more rigorous evaluation for the camera-ready version including the fair tuning of the hyperparameters.
1	The authors of this work introduced new metrics for node embedding that can measure the evolution of the embeddings, and compare them with existing graph embedding approaches, and experimented on real datasets.  All reviewers agreed that the work addresses interesting problem and that the proposed measures are nove, but there are too many flaws in the initial version of the paper, and despite the thorough responses of the authors, it is believed that there are still too many open questions for this paper to be accepted this year ICLR.
1	Overall, the paper provides interesting counter examples for the SGD with constant step-size (that relies on a relative noise model that diminishes at the critical points), which provide critical (counter) insights into what we consider as good convergence metrics, such as expected norm of the gradient.   The initial submission took a controversial position between the mathematical statements and the presentation of the statements on the behavior of the SGD method in non-convex optimization problems. While the mathematical is sufficient for acceptance at ICLR, the presentation was inferring conclusions that could have been misread by the community.  I am really happy to state that the review as well as the rebuttal processes helped improved the presentation of the results that I am excited to recommend acceptance.
1	All reviewers consistently agree on the high quality of the research presented in this paper, such that it the paper clearly is significantly above the acceptance threshold of ICLR.
1	TAP-Vid presents a benchmark that will be highly useful for tracking research for tracking arbitrary physical points on surfaces over long video clips. The reviews are all positive, with one reviewer raising ethical aspects in preparing the benchmark.  I find the rebuttal sufficient and adequate and hence recommend acceptance of the paper.
1	Dear authors,   Congratulations on your paper being accepted! The reviewers unanimously recommended acceptance. The reviewers made a number of recommendations on how to improve the paper further, in particular with respect to clarity of writing and explaining the motivation behind different analyses. We strongly encourage you use this feedback to improve the paper— if needs be additional clarifications can be added in the supplement. In addition, it would indeed be highly useful to make your source code publicly available, as you indicated in your response.   Best, your AC
0	This paper addresses a meta-learning method which works for cases where both the distribution and the number of features may vary across tasks. The method is referred to as 'distribution embedding network (DEN)' which consists of three building block. While the method seems to be interesting and contains some new ideas, all of reviewers agree that the description for each module in the model is not clear and the architecture design needs further analysis. In addition, experiments are not sufficient to justify the method. Without positive feedback from any of reviewers, I do not have choice but to suggest rejection.
1	The reviewers agreed that this paper should be accepted -- it studies an interesting and in someways "overlooked" problem and seems like it could be a starting point for others to build on. The paper did have some weaknesses. For example, we feel that the lack of experimental results is a missed opportunity -- the reviewers feel the paper would be made stronger by including at least a simple example where the standard approach of grid search + CV fails. Without such an example, it is a bit hard to be convinced of the importance of the problem being studied.
1	This paper discusses the likelihood ratio estimation using the Bregman divergence.  The authors consider the 'train-loss hacking', which is an overfitting issue causing minus infinity for the divergence.   They introduce non-negative correction for the divergence under the assumption that we have knowledge on the upper bound of the density ratio.  Some theoretical results on the convergence rate are given.  The proposed method shows favorable performance on outlier detection and covariate shift adaptation.  The proposed non-negative modification of Bregman divergence is a reasonalbe solution to the important problem of density ratio estimation.  The experimental results as well as theoretical justfication make this work solid.  However, there are some concerns also.  The paper assumes knowledge on the upper bound of density ratio and uses a related parameter essentially in the method.  Assuming the upper bound  is a long standing problem in estimating density ratio, and it is in practice not necesssarily easy to obtain.  Also, there is a room on improvements on readability.   Although this paper has some signicance on the topic, it does not reach the acceptance threshold unfortunately because of the high competition in this years' ICLR.
1	The paper worked on fully unsupervised anomaly detection and proposed to use self-supervised representation learning to improve the performance of one-class classification. This is a borderline case close to acceptance but cannot make it. Specifically, it is useful, but its novelty is the main issue, since it is not surprising that self-supervised representation learning can improve one-class classification without representation learning (this part is still much of the taste of ICLR) and an ensemble of multiple models can improve upon a single model (which is just "bootstrap aggregating" or "bagging" used everyday in practice and known to machine learning and statistics societies a very long time ago). After seeing the rebuttal, the concerns were not really addressed well and the issues were only partially solved. Thus, the paper is not enough to guarantee an acceptance to ICLR unfortunately.
1	Paper studies computing PPR in differential privacy setting. Given the importance of PPR in real world applications, we recommend accepting the paper as it brings an important problem to the DP community. However, we encourage authors to incorporate the comments from the authors, make sure that all the details of the proofs are made available in the final version, and clarify any comments reviewers raised. In particular, we encourage the authors to adequately address the criticisms of @Reviewer MDNv in the true spirit of science.
1	Authors study generalization properties of gradient-based optimization algorithms via a PAC-Bayesian approach. Based on a data-dependent prior, authors establish a generalization bound for FGD, FSGD, GLD, and SGLD. The authors also provide convincing empirical studies to demonstrate that their results are not vacuous.  - Authors should better motivate the use of their seemingly synthetic algorithms.  - There are many typos in this paper, other than the ones listed by the reviewers. Although the reviewers did not raise this issue, authors should make sure their paper is ready for camera ready if the paper is accepted.
1	This work is clear, very original, however it lacks a bit of significance and is more of a proof of concept. Here are the pros and cons I've identified.  Pros : - This work deals with physics-based deep learning which is a very recent subject and one of growing interest for the medical community. - Results on simulated data look promising. - The theoretical part and the implementation is clear, too bad the code is not shared.  Cons : - The responses to the reviewers are very dense, often repeat the same explanations from one reviewer to another and lack relevance. It is not clear what has been changed in the manuscript in particular. - The proof of concept should have been to support in the claims of the authors, as well as the use of simulated data in the title as suggested by the last reviewer - In order to make the work more robust and quantitative, different physical models could have been considered, different Resnet architectures and an application to real data.  This work is extremely interesting but still a little immature. So I suggest an acceptation as a poster.
1	DictFormer is a method to reduce the redundancy in transformers so they can deployed on edge devices. In the method, a shared dictionary across layers and unshared coefficients are used in place of weight multiplications. The author proposed a l1 relaxation to train the non-differentiable objective  to achieve both higher performance and lower parameter counts.  All reviewers ended up giving the paper a score of 6 after increasing their scores during discussions. While the results are strong (better performance at much lower parameter counts), the paper is not clearly written. Several reviewers noted that the paper is difficult to understand and has a few unresolved points. For example, the method also ended up performing better than the base transformer model that DictFormer is supposed to compress. There seems to be a lack of understanding about what part of the model delivered the improvements. One reviewer said that this is potentially a great paper that deserves to be better explained. The basic concept of sharing a dictionary across layers should be simple enough to explain well and deserve a better explanation than eq 5.   The authors promise to release the code, which would be necessary for a full dissemination of this work. I recommend accept.
1	Meta Review: This work proposes a data poisoning attack for off-policy evaluation (OPE) methods. It also shows that several popular OPE methods are not robust to data poisoning attacks. The reviewers were all positive on this work, recommending strong accept, accept, accept, and weak accept. They praised the generality of the proposed problem and framework.  One main criticism that arose in several of the reviews was a lack of a stronger baseline comparator. In their response, the authors pointed out the challenge of identifying a suitable baseline, given a lack of previous work in data poisoning for off-policy evaluation. In an attempt to provide a suitable baseline, they developed their own comparator, namely a variant of the Fast Gradient Sign Method. They then showed that their main proposed framework outperforms this comparator. In my view, this response adequately addressed this reviewer critique.  The reviewers also made a number of other relatively minor comments and suggestions, and the authors addressed these in their replies.
1	The covered topic is timely and of potential impact for many application domains, such as drug design. The paper is well written and presentation is clear. The proposed approach seems to have some degree of originality. Experimental results seem to be generally good, and in the rebuttal the authors have provided further experimental support to their main claim.  There are however some issues that have not been solved by the author’s rebuttal. I think two of them are the most important and related:   i) significance of contribution: although the authors have tried in the rebuttal to explain how the proposed approach differs from related papers, it seems that there are still doubts about the amount of innovation introduced by the paper. This issue could have been mitigated by SOTA experimental results in presence of a proper model selection, that, however does not seem to be the case here (see next point);  ii) model selection: the authors did not clearly explain the model selection procedure in the rebuttal. This is an important issue since it is often easy to get good results by picking the best run a posteriori. Unfortunately in the literature there are highly cited papers where model selection is not performed in a proper way and reviewers very often reject papers just looking at numbers without looking at how the numbers were obtained. So, I believe it is important to accept only papers where model selection is properly done and properly explained, so to allow for reproducibility of experiments.
1	The reviewers all found that the Consensus method introduced seemed sensible and applauded the authors on their extensive experiments.  However, clearly they struggled to understand the paper well and asked for a clearer and more formal definition of the methods introduced.  Unfortunately, the highest scoring review was also the shortest and also indicated issues with clarity.  It seems like the authors have gone a long way to improve the notation, organization and clarity of the paper, but ultimately the reviewers didn't think it was ready for acceptance.  Hopefully the feedback from the reviewers will help to improve the paper for a future submission.
1	This work proposes an approach to unify pre-training-based and meta-learning-based few-shot learning, inspired by dropout.  None of the reviewers support the acceptance of this work, despite the authors' detailed rebuttals, with the majority of reviewers confirming their preference for rejection following the author response.   I unfortunately could not find a good reason to dissent from the reviewers majority opinion, and therefore also recommend rejection at this time.
1	The paper analyzes diffusion-based deep generative models (DDGMs). The paper postulates that a DDGMs can be divided into two parts, a denoiser and a generator.   After the rebuttal and discussion period, three out of four reviewers supported acceptance of the paper. The reviewers aLmZ, QKfo, and 4jY9 all find the interpretation of a diffusion-based deep generative model as a decomposition of a generator and denoising part interesting. Those reviewers also note that this interpretation is useful as parts of the diffusion steps can potentially be replaced with a VAE, which would make the synthesis more efficient.  The reviewers aLmZ and QKFo also note that one comparison is perhaps slightly unfair in that the number of parameters of the two models considered was different; the authors cleared this up with new simulations showing that matching the number of parameters (as should be done for a better comparison) does not substantially change the conclusions of the experiment.   Finally, reviewer s9uB finds the approach and observations not to be novel and states that similar observations have been made in a recent CVPR paper by Benny and Wolf. While both the paper by Benny and Wolf and the paper under review study denoising diffusion models, the approaches taken by the two papers are substantially different, and both provide value to the community.  I also find the interpretation of the DDGMs as a denoiser and generator to be interesting and useful and therefore recommend acceptance of the paper.
1	The paper deals with accelerated methods on Riemannian manifolds. A particular challenge that the paper tries to address, which the AC believes is important, is related to the bounding of the iterates. The paper starts with an explicit bounding constraint on the manifold (and relaxes to the ball constraint for certain manifolds) and shows that the proposed algorithm can respect that while achieving acceleration. The reviewers including this AC see the merits of the paper. However, the paper in its current form is far from complete. A particular concern is on the empirical performance of the algorithm, resolving which should strengthen the paper. I would encourage the authors to build on the discussions and polish the paper accordingly.  Even though the paper has positive scores, the paper in its current form is a borderline paper with significant scope for improvement. To this end, the AC cannot accept the paper.
0	This proposal introduces CylesGym, the first Reinforcement Learning (RL) benchmark targeted at long horizon decision making in agriculture. Crucially, while prior work addresses single-year decision making, CylesGym captures the long term effects that one year's crop has on future generations.   The benchmark is clearly highly relevant and opens up a new frontier for RL researchers, making it a valuable contribution to the field. Furthermore, the benchmark does a good job of highlighting interesting opportunities for RL method development, such as costly information gathering, and evaluating current algorithms compared to baselines.   There was an active discussion between the reviewers and authors of the benchmark which resolved the majority of issues raised in the initial reviews. As a result there is broad support across the reviewers for the paper. A lingering concern is the sim-to-real gap which is mentioned at a number of places in the paper but could be emphasised more.   Lastly, the paper is well written and the evaluation sound. I believe this benchmark will be welcome by the community but I recommend that the authors address the concerns regarding the writing raised by  Reviewer MEYG, in particular regarding the utility for the agriculture community. In general I do not believe that issues which can be addressed in writing should be a reason to reject but those concerns should be addressed for the final version.
1	This paper studies the problem of simple question answering over new, unseen domains during test time. A domain adaption framework and a seq2seq question generation method have been proposed to tackle this problem and demonstrates significant improvements over the previous baselines.  All the reviewers agreed that this paper is well-written and the results are convincing, but the problem is relatively narrow with a focused contribution.  Several reviewers also questioned whether this paper contains enough technical contributions. Some other issues have been already addressed during the discussion phase (long tail relations, presentation issues, and adding more related work).  However, we recommend accepting the paper considering the simplicity and effectiveness of the approach. We think it would lead to more discussion/future work in this direction.
1	Reviewers agreed that this work is well-motivated and presents a novel approach for data augmentation around the adaptive augmentation policies. There were some concerns around the lack of ablation studies and unclear performance improvements, which were addressed well by the authors’ responses. Thus, I recommend an acceptance.
1	This paper is a computational linguistic study of the semantics that can be inferred form text corpora given parsers (which are trained on human data) are used to infer the verbs and their objects in text. The reviewers agreed that the work was well executed, and that the experiments comparing the resulting representations to human data were solid. The method employed has little or no technical novelty (in my opinion, not necessarily a flaw), and it's not clear what tasks (beyond capturing human data) representations could be applied to (again, not a problem if the goal is to develop theories of cognition).   The first draft of the work missed important connections to the computational linguistics literature, where learning about 'affordances for verbs' (referred to as 'selectional preferences') has long been an important goal. The authors did a good job of setting out these connections in the revised manuscript, which the reviewers appreciated.   The work is well executed, and should be commended for relating ideas from different sub-fields in its motivation and framing. But my sincere view is that it does not meet the same standards of machine-learning or technical novelty met by other papers at this conference. It is unclear to me what the framing in terms of 'affordance' adds to a large body of literature studying the semantics of word embeddings, given various syntactically and semantically-informed innovations.  It feels to me like this work would have been an important contribution to the literature in 2013, but given the current state of the art in representation learning from text and jointly learning from text and other modalities, I would like to have seen some attempt to incorporate these techniques and bridge the gap between the notion of affordance in text/verbs (selectional preference) and Gibson's notion of object affordance (what you can do physically with an object) in experiments and modelling, not just in the discussion. Such a programme of research could yield fascinating insights into the nature of grounding, and the continuum from the concrete, which can be perceived and directly experienced, to the abstract, which must be learned from text. I encourage the authors to continue in this direction. An alternative is to consider submitting the current manuscript to venue where the primary focus is cognitive modelling, and accounting for human, behavioural data, and where there is less emphasis on the development of novel methods or models.  For these reasons, and considering the technical scope of related papers in the programme, I cannot fairly recommend acceptance in this case.
1	This paper proposes Concept Embedding Models, which learn interpretable high-dimensional concept representations to exploit the tradeoff between accuracy, interpretability, and interventions on concepts. Reviewers vote for accepting this paper. The authors are encouraged to further improve this work based on reviewers’ comments in the camera ready and put the new experiments and discussions during the author-reviewer discussion phrase into the final revision, in particular the following:  - Add statistical significance test of experimental results - Compare training costs and model sizes - Better justify the proposed CAS mechanism - Investigate the robustness of learned concepts - Address the fairness concerns raised by reviewers in comparison with baselines
1	All reviewers appreciated the quality of the paper, its contributions, clarity and theoretical justification, and novelty. I agree with the reviewers in recommending acceptance.
1	This is a borderline paper with some reviewers voted for acceptance and some think it is not still ready. What is clear is more efforts by the authors is needed to make the paper appealing to reviewers with different interests. Changes such as better writing, more in depth literature review, more convincing experiments can definitely improve the quality of the paper. I personally do not think regret analysis is needed for this work, but it was mentioned by a reviewer. I would suggest the authors to use the reviewers' comments, revise their work, and prepare it for future conferences.
0	All three reviewers initially recommended reject.  The main concerns were: 1) weak technical contribution and insight [R1, R2, R3, R4]; 2) incremental novelty (another variation of SiamFC) [R1, R2, R3]; 3) unconvincing experiment results against missing SOTA [R1, R2, R3];  The author's response did not assuage these concerns.
1	The paper introduces new methods and building blocks to improve hyperbolic neural networks, including a tighter parameterization of fully connected layers, convolution, and concatenate/split operations to define a version of hyperbolic multi-head attention. The paper is well written and relevant to the ICLR community. The proposed methods offer solid improvements over previous approaches in various aspects of constructing hyperbolic neural networks and also extends their applicability. As such, the paper provides valuable contributions to advance research in learning non-Euclidean representations and HNNs. All reviewers and the AC support acceptance for the paper's contributions. Please consider revising your paper to take feedback from reviewers after reubttal into account.
1	A key discussion point in the rebuttal phase was the practical use of the proposed bounds, which two of the three reviewers brought up. The authors in response added an additional section (Section 6) and experiment to address this concern. While some concerns regarding the practical use of these bounds remain, the authors have made a sufficiently convincing case in my view. Hence, I recommend acceptance.
1	This paper was reviewed by 3 experts in the field. The reviewers raised their concerns on lack of novelty, unconvincing experiment, and the presentation of this paper, While the paper clearly has merit, the decision is not to recommend acceptance. The authors are encouraged to consider the reviewers' comments when revising the paper for submission elsewhere.
1	This paper proposes an approach for improving MultiTaskLearning by providing a way of incorporating task specific information.  Pros: 1) All reviewers agreed that the paper is clearly written 2) Interesting to see a single model for AST, STS (speech-to-speech translation) and MT   Cons: 1) The work is not adequately compared with related work (some important references are also missing) - The authors did perform some additional experiments with T5  and pointed out some drawbacks but this needs to be explored a bit more. 2) The answers about scalability are not very convincing and need more empirical results.   Overall, none of the reviewers were very positive about the paper and felt that while this is a good first attempt, more work is needed to make it suitable for acceptance.
0	The paper in its most recent version claims that deep neural networks, when very carefully regularized, outperform methods such as Gradient Boosting Trees on tabular data. This is genuinely surprising to me (in a good way), and I suppose it is as well to the community.  The paper initially received negative reviews with two key remarks that "The results are somewhat expected." (R4, R3, R2). Indeed, the original version mainly stated that very careful regularization helps on tabular data.  Naturally, the reviewers (including myself) seen then as the second key weakness that "All experiments are run on tabular data." (R4, R3).  Based on the reviews, the Authors have clarified and changed their message. I think it is well summarized by R2 "The paper has been significantly refocused and now sells itself as a way of deep neural networks being competitive versus gradient boosting methods, which are dominating the tabular heterogeneous tasks."  As R2 said and was reflected in comments by other reviewers, "[...] convinced by authors response on paper novelty, technical contribution and (after the re-focusing) potential usefulness to the community".  Given the new message of the paper, a key new question surfaces. Is this indeed the first convincing demonstration that deep learning can outperform more standard methods on tabular data? R2 pointed out TabNet (see also Google Cloud offering) that already in 2019 claimed "beating GB methods for the tabular data". There is also NeurIPS work "Regularization Learning Networks: Deep Learning for Tabular Datasets"; their abstract opens with "Despite their impressive performance, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) typically underperform Gradient Boosting Trees (GBTs) on many tabular-dataset learning tasks. We propose that applying a different regularization coefficient to each weight might boost the performance of DNNs by allowing them to make more use of the more relevant inputs". The latter work did not claim to beat GBT. Regardless, the two works should be carefully discussed and compared empirically to in the new version of the work.   I am also not yet fully convinced by the added comparison to GDBT. Arguably, AutoML from the sklearn package is not the most popular way to use GDBT in practice. How would regularization cocktails compare to GDBT from XGBoost, optimized using either random search or bayesian optimization?  Based on the above, I have to recommend the rejection of the paper. The key reason is: *the new reframing of the paper is exciting but warrants a much more detailed and careful evaluation*.  I really appreciate the work the Authors have put in clarifying and changing the message of the paper. I understand this is disappointing that we won't be able to include the work in ICLR. Nevertheless, I hope that the Authors found the feedback useful, and wanted to thank the Authors for submitting the work for consideration in ICLR.
1	The initial reviews for this paper were very borderline. The authors provided detailed responses as well as a few additional results and observations. The authors' responses answered the reviewers' questions and addressed their main comments (including in the discussion of related works as well as with more in-depth analysis in a new Section 5.1). Unfortunately, the reviewers did not come to a consensus.  Overall, this paper extends some current methodology for emotional classification, is well-executed, and provides a reasonably thorough study. The results are somewhat in line with previous results from other fields (and notably NLP), but the authors demonstrate the efficacy of using primary multi-task learning for multimodal conversational analysis.   Unfortunately, this paper also has some flaws as highlighted by the initial reviews. As stated above, the authors did provide a strong rebuttal, but given the different comments raised by the reviewers that spanned many aspects of the paper including motivation, possibly limited contribution and novelty, missing related work, somewhat shallow analysis of the results, I find that another full round of reviewing would be useful to assess the paper.  As a result, this remains a very borderline paper, and given the strong competition at this year's conference, I cannot recommend acceptance at this stage.  I suggest that the authors incorporate some of the discussions from this forum (and especially with respect to related work, new findings, and clearly defining the motivation and contribution of this work) into the next version of their paper.
1	The work describes the use of RL for trajectory planning for minimally invasive liver tumor ablation. The main motivation is that RL can accelerate planning over conventional methods.  Strengths according to reviewers: * Interesting problem. * Relatively well written. * Good description of RL methodology.  * Interesting results (comparable performance to conventional method, faster inference) * Uses public database, which may facilitate reproducibility and comparisons in future work.   Weaknesses: * Limited novelty with respect to machine learning. Main contribution is rather the idea of using RL to improve the specific application. * Not extensive evaluation.  Initial reviewer concerns regarding weak motivation and clarity were addressed to a significant extent, improving the manuscript, which is reflected to the increased ratings after rebuttal.   After a very productive rebuttal and discussion period, accompanied with significant updates to the paper, there seems to be a concensus that the paper is of acceptable quality for a publication in MIDL.
0	The paper proposes a method to improve adversarial robustness by diversifying the ensemble.   Novelty: As pointed out by several reviewers, promoting diversity of ensembles has been done in the literature, but there's still a moderate novelty in proposing the DML layer.   Empirical validations: The original submission lacks many important comparisons (e.g., with [1]). Despite the authors implicitly compared their method with (Pang et al) via Auto-attack in the rebuttal, it will be better if the comparisons are conducted in a well-controlled way to confirm that the improved robustness comes from DML instead of other hyperparameter settings. Further, it is not clear whether the proposed method is robust to hyperparameters.   Based on these, we recommend rejection but encourage the authors to improve their paper based on the comments.
1	This paper considers the following problem in distributed optimization: To train an overparameterized model over a set of distributed nodes, what is the minimum number of bits required to reach zero loss. The paper gives lower bounds on the bit complexity for two settings: non-convex functions satisfying a PL condition and overparameterized quadratics. The authors then give an algorithm that (1) for PL objectives, has optimal communication complexity (up to logarithmic terms in the dimension of the problem) and (2) for quadratic overparameterized objectives, attains optimal communication complexity (up to logarithmic terms) with high probability.  This paper generated significant discussion in the initial author-reviewer discussion period. Most of the reviewers were quite positive on the paper, and found the results to be interesting and relevant to the community, and found the paper to be well-written. They found the results, which provide near-optimal sample complexity for two settings (PL functions and overparameterized quadratics) to be technically strong, and were impressed by the tightness of the results. One reviewer took issue with certain limitations of the paper, including: - A limitation of the lower bounds in the paper is that they concern only deterministic methods. - The results are only tight with respect to the parameters $D$, $N$, and $\epsilon$, and are not necessarily tight with respect to $L$ and $\mu$. - Some related work can be discussed in more detail.  These limitations do not seem to take away from the novelty, and neither I nor the other reviewers were convinced by the other issues raised in the discussion. As a result, I believe the paper is worth accepting as a starting point for future research in this direction. Nonetheless, the authors are encouraged to expand the discussion around these issues and limitations in the final version of the paper, as well as expand the comparison to related work.
1	The paper proposes to treat object-centric models with iterative refinement procedures as fixed point operations and optimize them using implicit differentiation.  Overall, the reviewers find that the contribution of the paper is somewhat novel, although similar ideas have been presented in prior work in different contexts (supervised settings). Only one reviewer was more negative before the rebuttal, eventually increasing their score after discussion with the authors.  I, therefore, recommend acceptance and encourage the authors to address the comments raised by the reviewers in the final version.
1	As summarized by reviewer 5G2f, this paper proposes a novel learning-based approach to discover the modular concepts (i.e., modular structure) from raw CAD sketches. To tackle the problem, the authors first define a domain specific language (DSL) such that modular concepts can be represented in a network-friendly manner.  A Transformer-based detection module takes in a CAD sketch sequence and outputs a a set of latent embeddings, which are further decoded to parameterized modular concepts by a generation module. The whole model is trained in an end-to-end self-supervised manner, using reconstruction loss plus regularization terms.  The authors perform experiments on a large scale CAD sketch dataset and mainly demonstrate its applications for design intent interpretation (i.e., parse modular concepts from a raw CAD sketch) and auto-completion (i.e., complete a partial CAD sketch).  All reviewers recognize the novelty and contribution of this work, and the reviewer-author discussion was quite fruitful as many points, ranging from designer/user interaction, comparison to baseline methods, and issues with the library size are discussed and addressed. With such clear contribution and applicability to the CAD domain, I highly recommend the acceptance of this work.
1	Meta Review: The paper proposes a novel quantitative measure for risk in RL. The measure is sensitive to aleatoric and epistemic risk, and avoids some theoretical issues with previously proposed additive measures of the two types of risk. The paper also proposes a novel risk sensitive RL algorithm (based on ensemble bootstrapping and distributional RL). The method performs well empirically.  Pro: * All reviewers agree that the proposed measure and algorithm is novel, sound, and original.  * 3 out of 4 reviewers agree that the paper is well written.  * The topic of risk sensitive RL is timely and important - 3 out of 4 reviewers rate the potential impact as good (3). * Empirical results justify the theoretical claims and the method performs well compared to other distributional RL methods  Con: * In their initial assessment, reviewers point out minor technical flaws and some difficulties in understanding parts of the empirical evaluation. The authors have commented on the issues raised, but only 1 reviewer has responded to the authors' comments. * PeBL points out a potential shortcoming w.r.t. the training protocol (splitting the data). Authors acknowledge this and point to other papers in the literature using a similar protocol. * The method seems somewhat complicated and could perhaps be presented better - this is based on questions raised by reviewers, and these questions should be helpful for the authors to improve the camera-ready presentation.  **Justification of recommendation:** 3 of 4 reviewers are in favor of accepting the paper. The only (weakly) negative reviewer has raised some major issues that are answered in the appendix of the paper (but the reviewer did not find the appendix) and answered in other sections of the paper (as pointed out by the authors). To me, the authors have adequately addressed all major and most minor comments in their extensive response (including the major issues raised by the negative reviewer) - unfortunately only the most positive reviewer responded to the rebuttal. Taking all this information together I can still confidently recommend acceptance of the paper.
1	After the discussion phase, the author's resolved (nearly) all problems regarding reproducibility (although the score in the review was not updated). In addition, one reviewer also increased the score to 5 in their reply. In view of the strengths and importance of the topic, I recommend acceptance.
1	Reviews were split. Reviewers agreed on the importance of the domain but differed in how they valued the contribution over ProteomeTools, which the dataset builds upon. A primary concern was lack of baselines/benchmarking. The rebuttal argues that baselines would not add much value since strong methods have been published in prior work. However, my interpretation of the reviewers ask is not to invent new heuristic baselines but to evaluate the prior methods on the newly prepared dataset. The authors do add evaluation of one such model (Prosit) to the revision. Evaluating more models in the same way could strengthen the contribution, and could be part of the ongoing maintenance of the dataset / code.  Overall, however, the majority of reviewers felt the paper does provide significant value beyond ProteomeTools and other prior work, through the new annotations, tooling, and usage recommendations. The revision adds an appendix (G) to clarify these contributions, and it may be useful to move some of that text into the intro of the paper (as I think many readers will want to know what are the main contributions beyond the base dataset). I agree with the majority that there is significant value added and recommend acceptance.
1	This paper studies multi-objective RL, and in particular the settings of smooth concave scalarization, constraints, and max-min trade-off. The authors propose a framework for these problems called “anchor changing regularized natural policy gradient” (ARNPG) and show $O(1/T)$ convergence with exact gradients. The results do not require some of the assumptions used in related works such as ergodicity. The authors evaluate their approach on tabular environments, Acrobot, and (post-rebuttal) Hopper. The paper is well-written, the results seem correct, and the work provides a nice extension of the recent results on PG convergence to the multi-objective case. This contribution warrants acceptance despite the somewhat limited empirical evaluation.
1	The paper finally received three unanimous scores 6/6/7 and all the reviewers think the authors have addressed their initial concerns. The AC also think positive to this work and suggst to accept this paper.
1	The recommendation is based on the reviewers' comments, the area chair's personal evaluation, and the post-rebuttal discussion.   This paper provides novel insights into the effectiveness of various defenses proposed for graph neural networks. All reviewers find the results convincing and valuable. The authors' rebuttal has successfully addressed the reviewers' concerns. Given the unilateral agreement, I am recommending acceptance
1	The paper introduces the valuable idea of exploiting strong convexity of losses in online learning, together with variance-based regret bounds for contemporary algorithms like Squint and Metagrad, to introduce negative terms in cumulative regret bounds and make the algorithms useful in many applications such as early stopping in online-to-batch conversion and other settings.   A dominant concern from the reviewers' side was about the amount of (technical) material packed into the paper, which was alleviated by the detailed author response. As a result, the reviewers largely agree that the paper deserves to be accepted -- an opinion which I share.   PS. I request the author(s) to please resolve the incomplete [TODO]s in the paper checklist appropriately for the final version.
1	The reviews are a bit mixed. While all the reviewers feel that the paper proposed an interesting mechanism to train conditional generators from a single image and demonstrated good image editing results in the experiments, there are also common concerns about the practicality of the proposed method for interactive image editing. All the reviewers asked for the computation time, and some expressed the concerns about technical contributions. While these concerns were (somewhat) addressed in the rebuttal, the AC feels that it’s a hard sell to bet on the dramatic increase of computational capacity to make the computing time from an hour to realtime. Concerns about novelty also remained. Given the drawbacks, the final decision was to not accept. However, this work is promising and can be made stronger for publication in a later venue.
1	This paper proposes a new approach named geometric order learning (GOL) for rank estimation. Reviewers found that the idea is novel and the paper is well written. The authors have also clearly addressed most questions from reviewers in their responses. Thus, I recommend the acceptance of this paper.
1	This paper takes on (in my view) one of the most important questions in the lottery ticket literature today: how small are the smallest lottery tickets that exist in our neural networks? Many methods have been proposed for finding weak lottery tickets (those that require training to reach full accuracy) and strong lottery tickets (those that do not), but we have no idea how close they come to finding the smallest lottery tickets. Moreover, in many cases, we only know how to find lottery ticket subnetworks early in training rather than at initialization. Is this a fundamental limitation on the existence of lottery tickets, or is this simply a limitation of our methods for finding them? I am personally very involved in lottery ticket conversations in the literature, and I believe I can speak with some authority when I say that these are vital questions where any progress is important.  Moreover, these are exceedingly difficult research questions, and (again, in my view) the authors should be commended for taking them on. A naive approach to these questions would involve brute force search over all possible subnetworks, which is infeasible even on the smallest of toy examples, let alone the meaningful computer vision tasks where lottery ticket work typically focuses.  I am sharing all of this information to provide background for my confident recommendation to accept this paper over the many legitimate concerns expressed by reviewers and those that I saw when reading the paper in detail. Those include that: * This paper does not solve any of these research problems in their entirety. * It focuses on toy networks smaller than those traditionally studied in the lottery ticket literature, and it is well known that lottery ticket behavior changes in character at larger scales. * Planting good subnetworks may be an unrealistic proxy for the kinds of subnetworks that actually emerge naturally. * There may be multiple good subnetworks in a network, not just the one that was planted. * The graphs are a bit hard to read. * I find the mix of pruning methods studied, which were designed with very different goals (pruning after training, pruning before training, finding strong lottery tickets), a bit confusing.  **The bottom line:** With all of that said, in my view, the paper asks good questions and provides an initial foothold that other researchers will be able to build on as we seek more general answers. This is similar to the contributions made by Zhou et al., which started the conversation on strong lottery tickets, and potentially even Frankle & Carbin, which kicked off the lottery ticket discussion but got many things wrong. Both papers were good first attempts at solving big problems, and both were highly influential despite their flaws. Similarly, even if this submission isn't perfect in every way, this is among the most important kinds of contributions that a paper can make. For that reason, I strongly recommend acceptance under the belief that this paper will help to foster a valuable conversation in the literature.  P.S. I really, truly, strongly beg the authors to redo their graphs following the style of some of the more user-friendly lottery ticket or pruning papers they have cited (e.g., Frankle et al., 2021). The graphs in this paper were really hard to parse. Really really really hard to parse. They're too small, the y-axis is often squished, gridlines would be helpful, the lines are overlapping in ways that are difficult to distinguish because the colors blend, etc. etc. This is quite possibly the biggest impediment I see to this paper's ability to have broader influence.
1	The paper considers using neural networks to solve PDEs with complex geometry by incorporating hard constraint into the approximation function class. The method is interesting and useful for practical applications of neural-network based PDE solvers. The authors have adequately addressed the concerns by the referee. The meta-reviewer recommends acceptance of the paper.
1	The authors present a graph neural network for heterophilic data using gradient flows. The proposed architecture is quite simple...large sections of the architecture are fully linear dynamical systems rather than neural networks, and still achieve roughly SotA results on standard graph learning benchmarks. There was a significant amount of disagreement between the reviewers. Some seemed to think the strength of mostly linear methods meant that the benchmarks were too easy, but these are standard graph neural network benchmarks. A simple model performing well is not a negative, and can often be useful for puncturing hype (e.g. https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.13211). Simple architectures can also be useful for providing analytic insights which might get obscured in more complex models. Some reviewers seemed concerned about the scaling of certain tools (e.g. graph Laplacian eigenvectors), but these tools are only used for analysis, not for training. Nevertheless, I feel that there were enough general concerns around the paper that I have a difficult time recommending acceptance. Even if the purpose of the paper is primarily to drive analytic insights rather than achieve SotA results on big benchmarks, I would recommend the authors to show how these analytic insights can be used to improve models on big datasets to strengthen the paper.
1	This paper studies the quantile regression of censored data. Neural network models are used as the statistical model. Numerical results show the proposed algorithm is computationally efficient and attains high prediction accuracy compared to existing methods. Since reviewers agree that this paper is well written and interesting, I recommend accepting the paper.
1	This paper proposes an interesting collaborative multi-head attention (MHA) method to enable heads to share projections, which can reduce parameters and FLOPs of transformer-based models without hurting performance on En-De translation tasks. For pre-trained language models, a tensor decomposition method is used to easily covert the original MHA to its collaborative version without retraining.   This paper receives 3 weak reject and 1 weak accept recommendations. On one hand, all the reviewers agree that the paper is well motivated and the proposed idea is interesting. On the other hand, all the reviewers also commented that the current empirical results and comparisons are weak, which are not enough to support the paper's main claim. From the current results, it is difficult to draw a conclusion that collaborative MHA is better.   Specifically, (i) From Table 2, it can be seen that the proposed method is not effective for pre-trained models, i.e., even if the model size is not reduced much, the performance can be dropped significantly. (ii) More experiments, such as QA, more translation/generated tasks will make this paper more convincing. (iii) More rigorous experiments are needed to justify the practical value of the proposed method. If the authors try to emphasize that they go beyond practical realm, then probably a careful re-positioning of the paper is needed, which may not be a trivial task.   The rebuttal unfortunately did not fully address the reviewers' main concerns. Therefore, the AC regrets that the paper cannot be recommended for acceptance at this time. The authors are encouraged to consider the reviewers' comments when revising the paper for submission elsewhere.
1	This paper presents a new model for time series data that can handle data sampled at irregular time intervals.  The proposed model makes extensive use of continuous time processes in a GAN framework.  Experiment results show that the proposed model consistently outperforms existing approaches.  All reviewers lean on the accept side and I support that consensus.
1	Somewhat borderline paper given the scores, but leaning on the side of accepting mostly because the positive (and weak positive) reviews are a little more persuasive. The negative review is a bit of an outlier; the main issues raised in the negative review are that the novelty is on the lower side or otherwise that the work is incremental. These complaints are largely not shared by the other reviewers, and furthermore seem not like deal-breakers. Still a borderline paper, but fairly safe to accept.
1	There are contrasting review rating ranging from 9 to 3. The reasonable concerns about this paper not been well validated for ML community. The proposed datasets has been benchmarked with some classical and some relevant DL methods. I have taken into account the expertise of reviewers and their concerns carefully. I do agree with some reviewers opinion about this dataset will be importance to medical CV community. I do agree with authors response "The open questions for the ML community that OpenSRH may foster innovative discoveries include the following: 1) domain adaptation between SRH images and other histology images such as H&E images in the large scale TCGA project; 2) using multiple instance learning (MIL) to avoid expensive dense patch annotations; 3) different aggregation methods for patch-based training, including clustering, attention, or MIL; 4) self supervised learning and comparing different augmentation strategies for SRH images; and 5) data efficient training of ViT architectures using SRH data. " Even though the authors have not verified these innovative applications on the openSRH dataset. I will go with acceptance opinion of few reviewers for this paper.
1	All of the reviewers recommended acceptance, but the support was lukewarm, with the maximum score being “Weak Accept”. There were concerns about the limited applicability of the proposed method and lack of clarity of some of the arguments in the paper. Although the reviewers appreciated the mathematical foundations and experimental results, the negatives outweighed the positives.
1	**Overview** This paper provides a way to combine SVRG and greedy-GQ to improve the algorithm performance. In particular, the finite iteration complexity is improved from $\epsilon^{-3}$ to $\epsilon^{-2}$.  **Pros** The paper is well-written. Reviewers believe this is a solid theoretical work on advancing value-based algorithms for off-policy optimal control. It has sufficient theoretical advancement and experiments demonstrations of the methods.   **Cons** Some reviewers are concerned that SVRG is not SOTA. SVRG is not used in practice. The techniques appear to be similar to some existing works.   **Recommendation** The meta-reviewer believes that the paper has solid theoretical contributions. SVRG is a component in the new algorithm to improve the complexity. It does not need to be "useful" or "SOTA". The paper is also well-written. Hence the recommendation is accept.
1	The paper presents a sound and efficient (but not complete) algorithm for verifying that a piecewise-linear neural network is constant in an Lp ball around a given point. This is a significant contribution towards practical protection from adversarial attacks with theoretical guarantees. The proposed algorithm is shown to be sound (that is, when it returns a result, that result is guaranteed to be correct) and efficient (it is easily parallelizable and can scale to large networks), but is not complete (there exist cases where the algorithm will return "I don't know"). The experiments show good results in practice. The reviewers are positive about the paper, and most initial concerns have been addressed in the rebuttal, with the paper improving as a result. Overall, this is an important contribution worth communicating to the ICLR community, so I'm happy to recommend acceptance.
