0,"The paper investigates the capacity for neural language models to perform fast-mapping word acquisition using a proposed multimodal external memory architecture. Much work exists that shows that neural models are capable of following instructions whose meaning persists across episodes (i.e., slow-learning), however much less attention has been paid to instruction-following in a one-shot learning context. Using a simulated 3D navigation/manipulation domain, the paper shows that the proposed multimodal memory network is capable of both slow and one-shot word learning when trained via standard RL.

The submission was reviewed by four knowledgable referees, who read the author feedback and engaged in discussion with the authors. The paper is topical---one-shot language learning for instruction-following using neural models is of significant interest of-late. The reviewers agree that the proposed multimodal memory architecture is both interesting and technically solid. The reviewers raised concerns about the experimental evaluation and the role of embodiment. The author feedback together with discussion with reviewers were helpful in resolving some of these issues. However, the authors are encouraged to ensure that the paper clearly motivates the importance of embodiment to slow learning and fast-mapping, particularly given the large body of work in language acquisition in robotics, a truly embodied domain, which is notably missing from the related work discussion.

1,"This paper considers the problem of (biological) sequence design and optimization. The authors made an interesting yet important case that in certain sequence design tasks, a simple evolutionary greedy algorithm could be competitive with the increasingly complex contemporary black-box optimization models.

Most reviewers appreciate the design of the open-source simulation environment in benchmarking AdaLead (and other competing algorithms) in a number of biological sequence design tasks (e.g. TF binding, RNA, and protein). However, there is a common concern that the experimental results are not fine-grained enough to explain the outperforming results of the proposed algorithm. There are also unresolved comments on missing important BO baselines in the empirical study. As a purely empirical work, these appear to be important concerns. While these results appear to be useful for the domain of biological sequence design, the reviewers are unconvinced that the proposed algorithm is significantly novel, or the results are sufficiently compelling to merit an acceptance to this venue.

5,"This paper studies a timely problem and consider an interesting approach, but overall there were many concerns about technical details and the validity of the framework. The positive reviewer also mentioned concerns about the experiments, which others also found to be an insular comparison with weak baselines. Following the response period, in discussion there are additional concerns arising related to the lack of details, for instance related to possible unidentifiability of the model. As one reviewer discusses,  the authors are attempting to use RNNs to impute missing infection status labels when the missingness mechanism is assumed to be (i) not at random, (ii) playing out over time (as it is unclear whether Y^t is assumed (conditionally) independent of Y^t' with t' << t), and (iii) subject to interference (whether someone is tested is the 'treatment' here since it's a missingess problem and one person's propensity to be tested could causally affect another person's downstream infection status since apparently no Markov independence is assumed.

6,"The paper addresses the problem of domain generalization for learning spatio-temporal dynamics. It proposes a solution where an encoder captures some characteristics of a given environment, and a forecaster autoregressively predicts future dynamics conditioned on the characteristics learned by the encoder. Said otherwise, the forecaster learns the general form of dynamics parameterized by an environment representation extracted by the encoder. The conditioning is implemented via an adaptive instance normalization mechanism. A form of padding is also introduced in order to take into account boundary conditions. The two components encoder and forecaster are trained sequentially. This approach is casted in a meta-learning framework. Theoretical results inspired by multi-task learning and domain adaptation are also demonstrated. The model is evaluated and compared to different baselines on three problems, and for two different settings: varying initial conditions with a given dynamics, and dynamics with varying parameters.

This is a borderline paper. It targets a timely and important problem of domain generalization for dynamic environments. The proposed solution is original and compares well experimentally to several baselines. It allows for better generalization performance for the two test settings considered. In the current version, the paper however suffers from different weaknesses. First there is the imprecision of the arguments and the description of the experiments. Some of the arguments and claims are vague and sometimes abusive, not backed up by evidence. For example, a central claim is that the encoder learns time invariant quantities characterizing the environment when the learned representations indeed change with a time shift in the input for any environment. The same goes for the argument developed for the padding construction. It is claimed to model boundary conditions, but this is not supported by any theoretical or empirical evidence.
As noted by the reviewers, the theoretical analysis is disconnected from the algorithmic and experimental developments and does not bring much additional value to the paper. What is more embarrassing is that some of the claims in this section are overstated and induce incorrect conclusions.  From Theorem 3.1 and proposition 3.3, the authors suggest that multitask learning leads to better generalization than learning independently, while this is not formally guaranteed by the results (this is acknowledged by the authors in a later comment). Besides, the conditions of validity are not discussed while they seem to only cover situations for which the train and the test distributions are the same. The same holds for the second theoretical results (theorem 3.4). It is claimed that this result supports the authors’ idea of training encoder and forecaster sequentially, while it does not. Besides, the bounds in this result cannot be controlled as noted by the reviewers and are not useful in practice.

Overall, the paper addresses an important topic and proposes new solutions. The results are promising and it is indeed an interesting contribution. However, inaccuracies and incorrect or exaggerated claims make it difficult to accept the current version of the article. The article would make a strong and innovative contribution if it were written as a purely experimental article with a detailed description of the experiments and comparisons.

10,"This paper proposes a few-shot (untargeted) backdoor attack (FSBA) against siamese network-based visual object tracking. Contributions can be summarized as follows: First, this paper treats the attack task as an instance of multi-task learning and can be regarded as the first backdoor attack against VOT. Besides, a simple yet effective few-shot untargeted backdoor attack is proposed and achieves significant effectiveness in both digital and physical-world scenarios. This paper reveals the vulnerability of VOT to backdoor attacks caused by outsourced training or using third-party pre-trained models. One weakness is that threat model requires a very strong attacker with ability to modify the training algorithm, but only very simple defenses are considered. Overall, this is a good first attempt at showing vulnerability of VOT approaches.

A baseline attack (BOBA) consisting of a standard classifier backdoor against the classification head of a Siamese network is proposed.

- Provides a practical technique which can dramatically speed up PDE solving -- this is an important and widely applicable contribution.
- Paper is simultaneously clearly written and mathematically sophisticated.

Cons:
- There were concerns that the paper lacks novelty compared to Li et al 2020b, where the underlying theoretical framework was developed. The primary novelty would seem to be:
- - using Fourier transforms as the specific neural operator
- - the strength of the experimental results

24,"The paper considers a collaborative decision-making setting in which one agent can suggest actions for a listening agent to execute. The listening agent is not bound to take these suggested actions. The paper models the listening agent's decision-making process as a POMDP, treating the suggestions provided by other agents as observations (i.e., dependent only on the state) that are used to update the belief state. The paper describes two representations of the suggested actions and presents empirical results on simulated domains that demonstrate that the listening agent's performance improves when following the suggestions of a perfect oracle, while it degrades given imperfect suggestions in proportion to the level of noise.

The paper was reviewed by three researchers who read the author response and discussed the paper together with the AC. The reviewers largely agree that the collaborative decision-making problem as formulated is interesting. The reviewers find that the idea of formulating suggestion-following as a POMDP with suggestions modeled as observations is clever, and that the description of the proposed formulation is clear and easy to follow. The two formulations of the observation function are reasonable, albeit very simple initial models, though the paper does not provide much insight into when one should be used over the other. A primary concern with the paper is that it only provides empirical results. The work would have significantly benefited from theoretical results, which would help to understand how the method would generalize to other domains.

Another reviewer gave borderline reject (4) with the following remaining concerns:

(1) ""I think this scheme does not show advantages over the existing work. ""
But I don't think this is true, since as far as I know previous work did not show such an advantage of FP over INT.

(2) ""The practical application of the algorithm in this paper will bring extra overhead. ""
I agree the authors should give more details here (especially for flexible), but at least for the flex bias method, the extra overhead seems quite reasonable (as this is similar to the standard method used for INT), so I'm not sure what is the issue.  

(3) ""it is a very intuitive view that we should adopt a format with more exponent bits on the data with a large distribution range"". 
But the authors' response correctly said this is not true (as a uniform distribution would be better represented using INT, no matter what it's range), and is not what they are saying. 

Therefore, I think the reviewer had some errors in understanding here, and so I down-weighted this reviewer's score.

31,"Dear authors,

Your proposition of adding a noise scaling with the diagonal of the gradient covariance to the updates as a middle-ground between the identity and the full covariance is interesting and tackles the timely question of the links between optimization and generalization.

However, the reviewers had concerns about the experiments that did not reveal to which extent each trick had an influence.
I would like to add that, even though the term Fisher is used for both the true Fisher and tne empirical one, these two matrices encore very different kind of information. In particular, the latter is only defined when there is a dataset. Hence, your case study  (section 3.2) which uses the true Fisher does not apply to the empirical Fisher.

I encourage the authors to pursue in this direction but to update the experimental section in order to highlight the impact of each technique used.

33,"This paper considers the task of training policies for human-robot collaborative tasks and observes the need for out of distribution generalisation for human policies as a pre-requisite for training. The authors present an approach for learning a latent representation for human policies that may be adapted online. 

Reviewers consider the motivation compelling and highly relevant for assistive robotics applications. In particular, reviewers consider the idea of learning a latent space for human policies as elegant. Further, thorough comparisons with related efforts strengthen the paper’s arguments. 

The primary weakness of the paper is that the tasks used to evaluate the approach are relatively simple (reaching and itch scratching). This raises the question of whether and to what extent the method can scale to more realistic tasks. Any experiments to suggest that the approach can bridge the sim2real gap have been suggested since the current results are purely in simulation. A better technical exposition of the test time adaptation has also been suggested. 

During the rebuttal phase,  the authors provided additional clarification/results for key reviewer questions such as mechanism for generalisation, overfitting, choice/training of encoders and their inclusion strengthens the overall paper. The major quantitative evaluation is on moderately complex tasks (e.g., itch scratching) supplemented by a user study. The user study is conducted in lab scenario (not with real users) and the setup bears resemblance to human studies in other human-collaborative domains (such as driving, collaborative assembly etc.). 

Overall, the paper contributes an approach for learning latent representations from interaction data that can be adapted online based on distribution shifts observed online. The manuscript can be strengthened by a clearer exposition on the mechanism/nature of generalisation attained, mechanisms for preventing overfitting and and an analysis of potential scalability to complex scenarios. Further, since the learning problem is scoped towards the specific domain of assistive tasks (as opposed to general robot tasks), a clearer setup of the problem context and a statement on the scalability of the results to end-users may also be considered by the authors.

34,"The paper gives high probability bounds on excess risk for differentially private learning algorithms, in the setting where the loss is assumed to be Lipschitz, smooth, and assumed to satisfy the Polyak-Łojasiewicz (PL) condition. The key idea in the paper is to leverage the curvature in the loss (PL condition) and the generalized Bernstein condition. 

Authors show that they get sharper bounds of the order \sqrt{p}/(n\epsilon) when the loss is assumed to satisfy the PL condition besides being convex Lipschitz/smooth. Without using some curvature information about the loss function, the best upper bounds we can get are in the order of \sqrt{p}/(n\epsilon) + 1/\sqrt{n} — and this is tight at least in terms of the dependence on n given the nearly matching lower bounds — in fact, the dependence on n is tight as it matches the non-private settings.  

So, I find it a bit misleading when authors say that they improve over the existing results. That statement is not true in its generality — it is true that we can leverage the PL condition to give faster rates but that is not the setting of prior work. Again, the bounds that authors compare against are for smooth/Lipschitz convex loss functions and without any assumption on the curvature of the loss. 

If we do look at the literature for when and/or how can curvature help, we can compare against the existing bounds for strongly convex losses. The best-known result in the setting that is most closely related is that of Feldman et al. (STOC 2020): https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3357713.3384335. As we can check from Theorem 4.9 in that paper, the bounds we get are in the order of 1/n + d/n^2 which is actually better — not surprising since PL condition is a weaker condition. There is merit to the results in this paper but the current narrative is quite misleading and a more careful comparison with the existing literature is needed. The bounds are hard to parse — for example, what is the dependence on the strong convexity parameter (\mu)? It would also help to instantiate specific loss functions so that we can fix some of the parameters in the bound to have a clear comparison with the existing bounds.

38,"Summary of discussion: Three reviewers rated the paper Good (7) while Reviewer2 disagreed. R2's criticism was focussed on how this work is placed within existing/related literature, and no technical problem was identified. The authors have addressed some of R2's comments/concerns, R2 has not participated in the discussion.

Novelty and contributions: Overall the reviews seem consistent with an incremental paper which is technically valid, improves the state of the art on a reasonably difficult task. However, it does not appear from the reviews that the paper substantially advances our understanding of machine learning more broadly beyond this specific application.

Experiments: There is some disagreement among reviewers on the adequacy of the experiments, with at least two reviewers calling for experiments involving 'natural photos'. I believe the author's responses adequately address these concerns: they pointed out that the key selling point of their paper is the ability to model structured noise which is less relevant in natural photos.

On the balance of things, I think this paper should be accepted, but I wouldn't argue if it did not make the cut due to its narrow scope. For this reason, I recommended poster presentation.

Indeed, it is anticipated that widely-dispersed inference will have to deal with a highly-heterogeneous mix of clients. The study is quite thorough.

The method is conceptually simple and intuititive, the authors assume that concept labels for the images are available, and then go on to learn a mapping between the learned image vectors and the human-provided descriptions of the images. The key insight is to learn a reverse mapping, i.e., to map label vectors to representation vectors. Specifically, feature vectors are quantized using k-means to obtain clusters;  images are labeled (automatically) with a diverse set of concepts from expert models trained with supervision on
external data sources, and  a linear model is trained  to map concepts to clusters, measuring the mutual information between the representation and human-interpretable concepts.

",The paper compiles a dataset from various sources into one unified format for use in downstream research. This dataset can be used for pre-training and can provide useful insights into various social issues and data-related insights. The accompanying PoL-BERT language models do not seem to be trained optimally and their usefulness may be limited. The paper investigates the issue by curating and using a large open source legal dataset.

47,"The paper presents a new problem: open-set single domain generalization, where only one source domain is available and unknown classes and unseen target domains increase the difficulty of the task. To tackle this challenging problem, this paper designs a CrossMatch approach to improve the performance of SDG methods on identifying unknown classes by leveraging a multi-binary classifier. CrossMatch generates auxiliary samples out of source label space by using an adversarial data augmentation strategy. Then, the paper proposes a cross-classifier consistency regularization that minimizes the multi-binary classifier's output and one-vs-all multi-class classifier's output. 

The proposed OS-SDG is an interesting and realistic problem. However, since it is way more challenging, the optimal solution to it remains elusive. Some reviewers think the method might be heuristic and lack theoretical guarantees. Nevertheless, the results are promising and the paper makes a first step toward the challenging OS-SDG problem. Another concern is that the CCR loss needs more ablation studies to further analyze its role. Though the authors have added more explanation of this part, I suggest the authors put more ablation studies in the final supplementary document. 

Overall, the paper is novel and interesting.  I would recommend acceptance of this paper given its novelty and impressive performance, but I highly suggest the authors add more ablation studies in the final supplementary, as suggested by the reviewers.

48,"Overall, this paper achieves strong and interesting results regarding the query complexity of submodular maximization. One reviewer was concerned that the lower bound result was maybe a folklore result that is easy to prove. However, sufficient evidence to justify that claim was not provided and other reviewers did not share the same concern.

","The paper studies (mainly monotone) submodular maximization subject to various types of constraints. An approximation algorithm with a guarantee of 1/2-eps is developed whose running time is linear in n.

49,"This paper tackles the problem of feature interactions identification in black-box models, which is an important problem towards achieving explainable AI/ML. The authors formulate the problem under the multi-armed bandit setting and propose a solution based on the UCB algorithm. This simplification of the problem leads to a computationally feasible solution, for which the authors provide several theoretical analyses. The importance of the learned interactions is showcased in a new deep learning model leveraging these interactions, leading to a reduction in model size (thereby competing against pruning methods) as well as an improvement in accuracy (thereby competing against generalization methods). Although the proposed approach essentially builds on the specific UCB algorithm, it could likely be extended/modified to other (potentially more efficient) bandit strategies. A drawback of this work resides in the experiments being entirely synthetics. In order to close the gap with practice, experiments on real datasets of higher dimensionality should be conducted.
",The authors propose two key ideas. The first is using the UCB algorithm to identify strong feature interactions in a computationally efficient way. The second is that of using the identified pairwise interactions to build a lightweight GAM-like model that they call ParaACE.
