      "It is clear that FL will have to work with clients with diverse resources, a point that is appreciated. Indeed, it is anticipated that widely-dispersed inference will have to deal with a highly-heterogeneous mix of clients. The study is quite thorough. One aspect that is not convincing in the experiments is the budgets being exponentially distributed: having a strong concentration around a mean (with something like a Gaussian tail), or a power-law distribution, would be more suitable.\n",

      "Split-Max can adjust the model size according to the devices' budget while maintaining good accuracy and robustness. With customisation, the models are smaller and more robust under budget constraints. The idea of BN layer-wise mixing is kind of confusing. The reason of sharing all parameters except the batch-normalisation requires further elaboration. The assumption about the computational resources of clients would be better clarified. The evaluation results are heavily based on the assumption of exponentially distributed budgets. There is a large number of typos (mainly after Section 4). A sample: x1 net SHeteroFL seems to converge faster than slimmer nets till around round 50.
