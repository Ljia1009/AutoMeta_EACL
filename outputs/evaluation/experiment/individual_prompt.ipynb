However, substantial concerns were raised about the model motivation and the interpretation of the learned factors. To quote one reviewer, \"Some of these bells and whistles may not even be needed, so simplifying the model and streamlining the text would go a long way for me.\" Another said, \"The paper requires more principled motivation for the choices the authors made as well as cleaning up the notation.\"  The authors did address some of these concerns in discussion, but there are too many lingering concerns to recommend acceptance.  Given the unique application of this paper, the authors might also consider a journal that specializes in computational biology instead. \n",

      "The authors present a matrix factorization model to jointly characterize the lifetime interactions of thousands of bees over generations. I think the core idea is interesting, but I have mixed feelings about the method and some of the analyses. The evaluation metrics are a bit strange. The model performs worse than the baselines on reconstruction, though this does not seem to be the primary goal of the paper. The core idea (individual-specific time courses) seems to get buried and lost with other modeling innovations like adversarial training and new terms like \"individuality basis functions\" Some of these bells and whistles may not even be needed, so simplifying the model and streamlining the text would go a long way for me. My suggestion would be to focus on qualitative / visual comparisons across the different models.\n",

      "Review of a paper. Summarize the main content, strengths, weaknesses of the paper, and reviewer's decision on acceptance or rejection. This paper proposes a NMF formulation where A and F are different types of information extracted from social datasets. In the honeybee example the authors highlight, A represents the spatial relationship between bees, and F encodes the age of the bees. The variance of AMI score is high even when the SNR = inf. Do the authors consider the model results robust given this high variance in the synthetic dataset? The notation in Eq 3 is not clear. It would be easier to understand this work if the authors explained more detail the different variables/mappings. The authors claim that this interpretable representation of individual bees is valuable for understanding social dynamics in the colony.\n",

This work cannot be extended to CNNs with skip connections  easily due to the homogeneity assumption. It is not clear, whether the approach would work on deep networks, i.e., is the optimization only good for fine-tuning already good prototypes? Would it fail (completely) if they did not exist? Where failure could be that only a very small fraction (I am talking 1/10^6 or so) of reconstructed images are actual training data. If they used just one sample per class, it would be quite likely that it resembles a class-average.\n",

The authors hope that the results will help other researchers in the field to improve their understanding of the theory and practice of RSPPs. For more information on the study, go to: http://www.cnn.com/2013/01/29/science/features/topics/topical-algorithms-reconciliation.html#storylink=cpy.

The results provide basic guidelines for tuning hyper-parameters of the algorithms in practice. It would be informative to compare the convergence with high beta2 to SGD directly. The paper is of interest to the computer science community. It is well-written, clear and easy to read. I hope the authors can address my concerns to improve the quality of the paper. It's a good starting point for future work on the subject. I'm looking forward to reading the rest of the work. It will be interesting to see how the results are applied to the real world.\n",
