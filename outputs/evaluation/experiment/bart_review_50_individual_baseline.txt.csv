0,"The paper investigates the capacity for neural language models to perform fast-mapping word acquisition using a proposed multimodal external memory architecture. Much work exists that shows that neural models are capable of following instructions whose meaning persists across episodes (i.e., slow-learning), however much less attention has been paid to instruction-following in a one-shot learning context. Using a simulated 3D navigation/manipulation domain, the paper shows that the proposed multimodal memory network is capable of both slow and one-shot word learning when trained via standard RL.

The submission was reviewed by four knowledgable referees, who read the author feedback and engaged in discussion with the authors. The paper is topical---one-shot language learning for instruction-following using neural models is of significant interest of-late. The reviewers agree that the proposed multimodal memory architecture is both interesting and technically solid. The reviewers raised concerns about the experimental evaluation and the role of embodiment. The author feedback together with discussion with reviewers were helpful in resolving some of these issues. However, the authors are encouraged to ensure that the paper clearly motivates the importance of embodiment to slow learning and fast-mapping, particularly given the large body of work in language acquisition in robotics, a truly embodied domain, which is notably missing from the related work discussion.

","The authors use a 3D world to explore grounded language learning. An agent uses RL to combine novel word-learning with stably acquired meanings to successfully identify and manipulate objects. The results should be of interest to many working in grounded language / multimodal representation learning. The experiments on novel category + novel instance recognition are really convincing specifically for fast- mapping (4.1).

1,"This paper considers the problem of (biological) sequence design and optimization. The authors made an interesting yet important case that in certain sequence design tasks, a simple evolutionary greedy algorithm could be competitive with the increasingly complex contemporary black-box optimization models.

Most reviewers appreciate the design of the open-source simulation environment in benchmarking AdaLead (and other competing algorithms) in a number of biological sequence design tasks (e.g. TF binding, RNA, and protein). However, there is a common concern that the experimental results are not fine-grained enough to explain the outperforming results of the proposed algorithm. There are also unresolved comments on missing important BO baselines in the empirical study. As a purely empirical work, these appear to be important concerns. While these results appear to be useful for the domain of biological sequence design, the reviewers are unconvinced that the proposed algorithm is significantly novel, or the results are sufficiently compelling to merit an acceptance to this venue.

2,"This paper presents non-trivial and novel theoretical and computational modeling that accounts for experimentally observed phenomena: the theta phase procession and precession. These phenomena are implicated in the neural representation and learning of neuronal networks involving hippocampus. Although the current manuscript does not address the learning and the presentations are limited to a linear track environment, it represents a clear advance in linking spatial and temporal information representations by extending the standard continuous attractor models that do not exhibit phase procession/precession. Furthermore, the model elegantly explains the biologically observed unimodal and bimodal cells. The authors are encouraged to improve the clarity of some parts of the writing.

4,"The authors provide a benchmark for federated learning. 

The commonly mentioned strengths:
- there is a big need in the community for this type of work
- easily accessible code
- various levels of complexity with different granularity

Regarding the weaknesses, I see no showstoppers
- some feedback about the experiments done on the datasets -> this point comes back consistently among all reviewers, in terms of the amount, settings and reproducibility.. The authors are adviced to address this in future work, to keep momentum for the use of the community on this dataset 
- there was some discussion about tensorflow and pytorch, but based on the discussion both seem supported
- some settings / image types could be better supported

None of these weaknesses seem serious, and quite frankly, we can not expect one dataset to cover all possible settings. Since the reviewers are in agreement about the quality of this work, I recommend them for an oral presentation.

5,"This paper studies a timely problem and consider an interesting approach, but overall there were many concerns about technical details and the validity of the framework. The positive reviewer also mentioned concerns about the experiments, which others also found to be an insular comparison with weak baselines. Following the response period, in discussion there are additional concerns arising related to the lack of details, for instance related to possible unidentifiability of the model. As one reviewer discusses,  the authors are attempting to use RNNs to impute missing infection status labels when the missingness mechanism is assumed to be (i) not at random, (ii) playing out over time (as it is unclear whether Y^t is assumed (conditionally) independent of Y^t' with t' << t), and (iii) subject to interference (whether someone is tested is the 'treatment' here since it's a missingess problem and one person's propensity to be tested could causally affect another person's downstream infection status since apparently no Markov independence is assumed. There is also consensus that the writing quality can be greatly improved. Overall this work contains some ideas with potential in a thorough revision 

","The proposed approach formalizes an intuitive understanding of the spread of an infectious disease in (as far as I am aware) a novel way. Experimental results on a (private) real-world dataset are somewhat mixed, but show that MIINT achieves a better true positive rate at an acceptable false positive rate. With the current setup, it is not clear if MIINT in particular, or any approach which accounts for the graph, would outperform the baselines. Even using an oracle, Figure 1 seems to suggest that between 30-40% of the population would need to be tested to see a reduction in the infection rate. It seems a bit strange that the AUROC and AUPRC in Table 1 are almost perfectly negatively correlated. The paper is not well-written and pretty hard to follow.",0.13580246913580246,0.7685767412185669,0.7452776432037354,0.7567479014396667,INCORRECT,0.9877909421920776
6,"The paper addresses the problem of domain generalization for learning spatio-temporal dynamics. It proposes a solution where an encoder captures some characteristics of a given environment, and a forecaster autoregressively predicts future dynamics conditioned on the characteristics learned by the encoder. Said otherwise, the forecaster learns the general form of dynamics parameterized by an environment representation extracted by the encoder. The conditioning is implemented via an adaptive instance normalization mechanism. A form of padding is also introduced in order to take into account boundary conditions. The two components encoder and forecaster are trained sequentially. This approach is casted in a meta-learning framework. Theoretical results inspired by multi-task learning and domain adaptation are also demonstrated. The model is evaluated and compared to different baselines on three problems, and for two different settings: varying initial conditions with a given dynamics, and dynamics with varying parameters.

This is a borderline paper. It targets a timely and important problem of domain generalization for dynamic environments. The proposed solution is original and compares well experimentally to several baselines. It allows for better generalization performance for the two test settings considered. In the current version, the paper however suffers from different weaknesses. First there is the imprecision of the arguments and the description of the experiments. Some of the arguments and claims are vague and sometimes abusive, not backed up by evidence. For example, a central claim is that the encoder learns time invariant quantities characterizing the environment when the learned representations indeed change with a time shift in the input for any environment. The same goes for the argument developed for the padding construction. It is claimed to model boundary conditions, but this is not supported by any theoretical or empirical evidence.
As noted by the reviewers, the theoretical analysis is disconnected from the algorithmic and experimental developments and does not bring much additional value to the paper. What is more embarrassing is that some of the claims in this section are overstated and induce incorrect conclusions.  From Theorem 3.1 and proposition 3.3, the authors suggest that multitask learning leads to better generalization than learning independently, while this is not formally guaranteed by the results (this is acknowledged by the authors in a later comment). Besides, the conditions of validity are not discussed while they seem to only cover situations for which the train and the test distributions are the same. The same holds for the second theoretical results (theorem 3.4). It is claimed that this result supports the authors’ idea of training encoder and forecaster sequentially, while it does not. Besides, the bounds in this result cannot be controlled as noted by the reviewers and are not useful in practice.

Overall, the paper addresses an important topic and proposes new solutions. The results are promising and it is indeed an interesting contribution. However, inaccuracies and incorrect or exaggerated claims make it difficult to accept the current version of the article. The article would make a strong and innovative contribution if it were written as a purely experimental article with a detailed description of the experiments and comparisons.

","This work tackles the task of forecasting dynamics in different domains simultaneously. Using an encoder which is trained to determine the task, the inferred latent vector is then used to adapt a forecasting network to the task at hand. Experiments on three datasets linked to fluid dynamics are then conducted to assess the proposed model. This is a good work on a timely subject. The contribution is not groundbreaking but should be significant enough to warrant acceptance. It would be nice to see how the model deals with other families of dynamics. The setting of the experiments should be more precise. The theoretical analysis, inspired by existing work in multi-task learning / domain adaptation, has some limitations and does not add much value to the paper.

Besides, a simple yet effective few-shot untargeted backdoor attack is proposed and achieves significant effectiveness in both digital and physical-world scenarios.

16,"The paper addresses generalized zero shot learning (test data contains examples from both seen as well as unseen classes) and proposes to learn a shared representation of images and attributes via multimodal variational autoencoders. 
The reviewers and AC note the following potential weaknesses: (1) low technical contribution, i.e. the proposed multimodal VAE model is very similar to Vedantam et al (2017) as noted by R2, and to JMVAE model by Suzuki et al, 2016, as noted by R1. The authors clarified in their response that indeed VAE in Vedantam et al (2017) is similar, but it has been used for image synthesis and not classification/GZSL. (2) Empirical evaluations and setup are not convincing (R2) and not clear -- R3 has provided a very detailed review and a follow up discussion raising several important concerns such as (i) absence of a validation set to test generalization, (ii) the hyperparameters set up; (iii) not clear advantages of learning a joint model as opposed to unidirectional mappings (R1 also supports this claim).

",The paper considers the problem of (Generalized) Zero-Shot Learning. Most zero-shot learning methods embed images and text/attribute representations into a common space.

","The paper was published in the Journal of Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. The technique hinges on the fact that at the training data points, a linear combination of the derivatives of the network parameters can predict the parameters themselves. The approach produces convincing results in some of the standard computer vision datasets like MNIST and CIFAR10. This work cannot be extended to CNNs with skip connections  easily due to the homogeneity assumption. Not general enough to be applicable to Resnet networks. The paper has far reaching impact on privacy.

18,"The paper presents a construction for deep learning on point clouds that evolve over time. The key characteristics of the data are irregular sampling in the spatial domain and regular sampling in the temporal domain. The presented construction addresses both these aspects of the data.

","The proposed point spatio-temporal (PST) convolution operates on ""point tubes"" and decouples space and time through a shared spatial convolution at each timestep. The architecture operates on ordered point cloud sequences but does not leverage timestamps, so there is an underlying assumption that point clouds are sampled at a fixed rate that does not change from training to test time. Some important relevant works are not cited, e.g. in scene flow estimation. There is no significant difference with MeteorNet or even PointNet++.

20,"Three experts reviewed this paper and all recommended rejection. The rebuttal did not change the reviewers' recommendations. The reviewers was not excited by the proposed probabilistic framework and raised many concerns regarding the comparison with baselines and competing methods, limited size of datasets, and limited scope of one dataset for one task.

The authors are encouraged to consider the reviewers' comments when revising the paper for submission elsewhere.

","The authors propose a probabilistic framework to improve the classification accuracy in instances when there exists missing data in the multi-modality datasets. Experimental results on eNTERFACE and RAVDESS datasets demonstrate improvements in classification accuracy over baselines. The claims in the paper are largely unsubstantiated due to the lack of comparison to baselines as mentioned in the Main Review above. The classification accuracy of the “happiness” emotion by ZP is higher than that by the proposed method. This single value may be caused by several factors, hidden or accidental.

21,"I agree with the concerns raised by the reviewers. In particular, the issues of novelty and experimental evaluation (mentioned in the revision summary) remain the major weak points of the paper. My impression is that the changes made in the revision represent a significant experimental addition to the paper, one which might merit a full pass through peer review, and one which in any event did not alter the reviewers' scores. While I think this paper has something to contribute (and the empirical results suggest the method may outperform competitors), I think it would be improved by a rewrite (and possibly a restructure) that makes the part that is your contribution much more clear. For example, in the abstract, it's only in the sentence ""We show both theoretically
and empirically that potential vanishing/exploding gradients problems can be mitigated by enforcing orthogonality to the shared filter bases"" that we actually get to the part that is really novel about this contribution (the ""enforcing orthogonality""): that would ideally be much earlier in the abstract.

","The method proposes to decompose convolutional filters using a low rank filter basis. This filter basis is shared across layers in contrast to other works who look at recursive sharing. Experiments on ImageNet show that the method reduces 10.01M parameters of ResNet-34 with almost the same error rate, i.e., the method is more effective for DNN architectures without using separable convolution. A classic problem, exploding/vanishing gradients, is alleviated by keeping a variable W_basis close to orthogonal. The novelty/contribution is not quite sufficient. The proposed method should be compared with traditional methods. The strategy of convolution decomposing (as shown in Equation 3) in this paper is similar with separable Convolution used in MobileNet.",0.14383561643835618,0.7588118314743042,0.7474762797355652,0.7531014680862427,INCORRECT,0.9984196424484253

23,"The paper makes a novel contribution to methods for generating novel molecules from scratch. The core idea is to generate a shape that fits the molecular pocket without looking at the protein structure.

Two out of three reviewers recommended acceptance. Reviewers emphasize that the method is innovative and interesting, and the empirical performance appealing (especially given that only the shape information is provided to the model). Strong performance is enabled by good design choices made across the paper, such as including the pretraining stage.

The reviewer that recommend rejection raised issues related to the novelty and clarity of the paper. However, I believe the paper is sufficiently clear and novel to meet the bar for acceptance.

Overall, it is my pleasure to recommend acceptance of the paper.

24,"The paper considers a collaborative decision-making setting in which one agent can suggest actions for a listening agent to execute. The listening agent is not bound to take these suggested actions. The paper models the listening agent's decision-making process as a POMDP, treating the suggestions provided by other agents as observations (i.e., dependent only on the state) that are used to update the belief state. The paper describes two representations of the suggested actions and presents empirical results on simulated domains that demonstrate that the listening agent's performance improves when following the suggestions of a perfect oracle, while it degrades given imperfect suggestions in proportion to the level of noise.

The paper was reviewed by three researchers who read the author response and discussed the paper together with the AC. The reviewers largely agree that the collaborative decision-making problem as formulated is interesting. The reviewers find that the idea of formulating suggestion-following as a POMDP with suggestions modeled as observations is clever, and that the description of the proposed formulation is clear and easy to follow. The two formulations of the observation function are reasonable, albeit very simple initial models, though the paper does not provide much insight into when one should be used over the other. A primary concern with the paper is that it only provides empirical results. The work would have significantly benefited from theoretical results, which would help to understand how the method would generalize to other domains.

","The paper looks at the problem of designing a framework to support collaboration between an autonomous system and a human supervisor. The human is assumed to be a potentially suboptimal agent with full observability, while the agent is expected to operate under partial observability. The method proposes to use the action suggestions, by using the human policy as part of the observation model of the underlying POMDP. This means that the human suggestions could be used to refine the belief space the agent may hold regarding the current state. The paper is generally clear and easy to read.

25,"This paper had mixed reviews. 

One very positive expert reviewer (8) pointed out this paper used a rigorous approach to showing than FP8 can outperform INT8 in inference, which I agree is very interesting and useful.

 Another reviewer gave borderline acceptance (5), and I did not find any remaining concerns following the authors' response.

One reviewer gave borderline reject (4), but I did not find any remaining coherent major concerns following the authors' rebuttal. Also, this reviewer seemed less experienced, so I down-weighted this reviewer's score. 

Another reviewer gave borderline reject (4) with the following remaining concerns:

(1) ""I think this scheme does not show advantages over the existing work. ""
But I don't think this is true, since as far as I know previous work did not show such an advantage of FP over INT.

(2) ""The practical application of the algorithm in this paper will bring extra overhead. ""
I agree the authors should give more details here (especially for flexible), but at least for the flex bias method, the extra overhead seems quite reasonable (as this is similar to the standard method used for INT), so I'm not sure what is the issue.  

(3) ""it is a very intuitive view that we should adopt a format with more exponent bits on the data with a large distribution range"". 
But the authors' response correctly said this is not true (as a uniform distribution would be better represented using INT, no matter what it's range), and is not what they are saying. 

Therefore, I think the reviewer had some errors in understanding here, and so I down-weighted this reviewer's score.

27,"There is a clear consensus to accept this manuscript.  The results are impressive, and have a nice theoretical orientation that will allow the results to have continued impact as the field advances.  There are some minor errors by the authors in the discussions, which are worth the authors being aware of before submitting their final version.  In particular, they state that:

""The authors of [2,3] considered a bounded activation function in the infinite-width limit with large depth, in which case their variance 
V

 always converged to a finite fixed point when depth is large [2, eq. 3]. Their chaotic and ordered phases are then defined by the behaviour of the correlation fixed point [2, eq. 5], which in turn determines the behaviour of the gradient [2, eq. 16].

In our case, shaping the activation leads to an unbounded function, and consequently the variance 
V
ℓ
α
α
 is not always bounded - even if we take the same limit as [2] (but shaping depends on depth instead like the DKS/TAT papers), in which case we get an ODE with finite time explosion. Intuitively, if we drop the Brownian motion from eq. 18 and consider

31,"Dear authors,

Your proposition of adding a noise scaling with the diagonal of the gradient covariance to the updates as a middle-ground between the identity and the full covariance is interesting and tackles the timely question of the links between optimization and generalization.

However, the reviewers had concerns about the experiments that did not reveal to which extent each trick had an influence.
I would like to add that, even though the term Fisher is used for both the true Fisher and tne empirical one, these two matrices encore very different kind of information. In particular, the latter is only defined when there is a dataset. Hence, your case study  (section 3.2) which uses the true Fisher does not apply to the empirical Fisher.

I encourage the authors to pursue in this direction but to update the experimental section in order to highlight the impact of each technique used.

","Review of a paper that proposes a method to close the generalization gap that arises in training DNNs with large batch. The motivation behind using diagonal fisher for faster convergence is not clear to me, although in the experiment part, the comparison of some of the statistics of diagonal fisher appear similar to the small batch SGD. The experiments are conducted on MNIST and CIFAR10 and 100, which I feel is a bit insufficient for a paper. As in large batch training, we care more about bigger dataset such as ImageNet, and hence I would expect results reported on various models on ImageNet. It would be interesting to see the effect of how this term play on convergence rate, and also how the term scale with batch size.",0.17204301075268816,0.7831026315689087,0.7754472494125366,0.7792561650276184,INCORRECT,0.9811916947364807
32,"This work proposes algorithms for solving ERM with continuous losses satisfying the PL condition. The first algorithm achieves that by using a chainging noise variance and thus the paper frames the contribution in terms of the advantages of non-constant noise rate.

The problem is a well-studied one and the result is a nice if relatively modest improvement over Wang et al. However, as pointed out in reviews, in the context of convex optimization the same rate has already been established (Feldman,Koren,Talwar STOC 2020). This work is cited and briefly discussed but the discussion only includes one of the algorithms in the paper (that does have an additional log N factor). The overall assumptions in this paper are not comparable (weaker in some ways and stronger since they only require PL instead of strong convexity) but still the overall the contribution appears to be incremental.

","The problem studied is interesting and important for the privacy community. Excess risk upper bound is probably quite loose, so improving that may not necessarily improve actual excess risk. The log(N) improvement may be an artifact of the analysis, and not an inherent advantage of dynamic schedules.

33,"This paper considers the task of training policies for human-robot collaborative tasks and observes the need for out of distribution generalisation for human policies as a pre-requisite for training. The authors present an approach for learning a latent representation for human policies that may be adapted online. 

Reviewers consider the motivation compelling and highly relevant for assistive robotics applications. In particular, reviewers consider the idea of learning a latent space for human policies as elegant. Further, thorough comparisons with related efforts strengthen the paper’s arguments. 

The primary weakness of the paper is that the tasks used to evaluate the approach are relatively simple (reaching and itch scratching). This raises the question of whether and to what extent the method can scale to more realistic tasks. Any experiments to suggest that the approach can bridge the sim2real gap have been suggested since the current results are purely in simulation. A better technical exposition of the test time adaptation has also been suggested. 

During the rebuttal phase,  the authors provided additional clarification/results for key reviewer questions such as mechanism for generalisation, overfitting, choice/training of encoders and their inclusion strengthens the overall paper. The major quantitative evaluation is on moderately complex tasks (e.g., itch scratching) supplemented by a user study. The user study is conducted in lab scenario (not with real users) and the setup bears resemblance to human studies in other human-collaborative domains (such as driving, collaborative assembly etc.). 

Overall, the paper contributes an approach for learning latent representations from interaction data that can be adapted online based on distribution shifts observed online. The manuscript can be strengthened by a clearer exposition on the mechanism/nature of generalisation attained, mechanisms for preventing overfitting and and an analysis of potential scalability to complex scenarios. Further, since the learning problem is scoped towards the specific domain of assistive tasks (as opposed to general robot tasks), a clearer setup of the problem context and a statement on the scalability of the results to end-users may also be considered by the authors. 


","The paper tackles the problem of generalizing to out-of-distribution human behavior when using sim2real methods to develop assistive robotics capabilities. The work is done entirely in simulation with synthesized human behavior. It would strengthen the submission if the authors included some evaluation with realistic human preferences and behavior. The assumptions need to be very clearly specified in the paper and the claims should be carefully considered and re-worded. There is a lack of real-world experimentation for these methods. The paper can also be stronger by clarifying what personalization means in the context of learned embeddings (Section 3) The regularization term (eq. 3) is motivated by VAE formulation and helps in grouping similar humans closer. By similar humans, the paper probably means similar itch locations and history of actions ( a clarification would be helpful).",0.15384615384615385,0.8118215799331665,0.7773039937019348,0.7941879034042358,INCORRECT,0.9623824954032898
34,"The paper gives high probability bounds on excess risk for differentially private learning algorithms, in the setting where the loss is assumed to be Lipschitz, smooth, and assumed to satisfy the Polyak-Łojasiewicz (PL) condition. The key idea in the paper is to leverage the curvature in the loss (PL condition) and the generalized Bernstein condition. 

Authors show that they get sharper bounds of the order \sqrt{p}/(n\epsilon) when the loss is assumed to satisfy the PL condition besides being convex Lipschitz/smooth. Without using some curvature information about the loss function, the best upper bounds we can get are in the order of \sqrt{p}/(n\epsilon) + 1/\sqrt{n} — and this is tight at least in terms of the dependence on n given the nearly matching lower bounds — in fact, the dependence on n is tight as it matches the non-private settings.  

So, I find it a bit misleading when authors say that they improve over the existing results. That statement is not true in its generality — it is true that we can leverage the PL condition to give faster rates but that is not the setting of prior work. Again, the bounds that authors compare against are for smooth/Lipschitz convex loss functions and without any assumption on the curvature of the loss. 

If we do look at the literature for when and/or how can curvature help, we can compare against the existing bounds for strongly convex losses. The best-known result in the setting that is most closely related is that of Feldman et al. (STOC 2020): https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3357713.3384335. As we can check from Theorem 4.9 in that paper, the bounds we get are in the order of 1/n + d/n^2 which is actually better — not surprising since PL condition is a weaker condition. There is merit to the results in this paper but the current narrative is quite misleading and a more careful comparison with the existing literature is needed. The bounds are hard to parse — for example, what is the dependence on the strong convexity parameter (\mu)? It would also help to instantiate specific loss functions so that we can fix some of the parameters in the bound to have a clear comparison with the existing bounds.

","The paper achieves high probability excess risk bound with rate O(1/n) w.r.t n for DP models via uniform stability by using Generalized Bernstein condition under G-Lipschitz, L-smooth, and PL condition.

38,"Summary of discussion: Three reviewers rated the paper Good (7) while Reviewer2 disagreed. R2's criticism was focussed on how this work is placed within existing/related literature, and no technical problem was identified. The authors have addressed some of R2's comments/concerns, R2 has not participated in the discussion.

Novelty and contributions: Overall the reviews seem consistent with an incremental paper which is technically valid, improves the state of the art on a reasonably difficult task. However, it does not appear from the reviews that the paper substantially advances our understanding of machine learning more broadly beyond this specific application.

Experiments: There is some disagreement among reviewers on the adequacy of the experiments, with at least two reviewers calling for experiments involving 'natural photos'. I believe the author's responses adequately address these concerns: they pointed out that the key selling point of their paper is the ability to model structured noise which is less relevant in natural photos.

On the balance of things, I think this paper should be accepted, but I wouldn't argue if it did not make the cut due to its narrow scope. For this reason, I recommended poster presentation.

39,"This paper proposes a federated learning (FL) scheme that is suitable for clients/devices with heterogeneous resources. The scheme Split-Mix trains multiple models of different sizes and adversarial-robustness levels, which are tailored to the budgets of the individual device. Empirical results show encouraging results.

It is clear that FL will have to work with clients with diverse resources, a point that is appreciated. Indeed, it is anticipated that widely-dispersed inference will have to deal with a highly-heterogeneous mix of clients. The study is quite thorough. One aspect that is not convincing in the experiments is the budgets being exponentially distributed: having a strong concentration around a mean (with something like a Gaussian tail), or a power-law distribution, would be more suitable.

","Split-Mix is a Federated Learning strategy aimed at easing the problems that arise when a heterogeneous pool of devices/clients collaboratively train a global model. The key idea is threefold: the global model is first split into several sub-networks called base models that each have different sizes. All base models are trained on all clients (should these meet the compute requirements of a sub-model) in a federated manner. The more capable devices, train all base models. This is envisioned to happen in a parallel fashion in a given device. Once FL training is completed, a customized model can be deployed to a device/client in hardware-aware fashion.

45,"This paper proposes a method for inspecting and interpreting the visual representations learned by self-supervised methods. 
The method is conceptually simple and intuititive, the authors assume that concept labels for the images are available, and then go on to learn a mapping between the learned image vectors and the human-provided descriptions of the images. The key insight is to learn a reverse mapping, i.e., to map label vectors to representation vectors. Specifically, feature vectors are quantized using k-means to obtain clusters;  images are labeled (automatically) with a diverse set of concepts from expert models trained with supervision on
external data sources, and  a linear model is trained  to map concepts to clusters, measuring the mutual information between the representation and human-interpretable concepts.

Reviewers raised some questions regarding the relation of the approach to topic models, the difference between reverse probing and linear probing, implementation details and computation. The authors addressed reviewers comments convincingly with additional experiments and/or explanations.

49,"This paper tackles the problem of feature interactions identification in black-box models, which is an important problem towards achieving explainable AI/ML. The authors formulate the problem under the multi-armed bandit setting and propose a solution based on the UCB algorithm. This simplification of the problem leads to a computationally feasible solution, for which the authors provide several theoretical analyses. The importance of the learned interactions is showcased in a new deep learning model leveraging these interactions, leading to a reduction in model size (thereby competing against pruning methods) as well as an improvement in accuracy (thereby competing against generalization methods). Although the proposed approach essentially builds on the specific UCB algorithm, it could likely be extended/modified to other (potentially more efficient) bandit strategies. A drawback of this work resides in the experiments being entirely synthetics. In order to close the gap with practice, experiments on real datasets of higher dimensionality should be conducted.
