0,"The paper investigates the capacity for neural language models to perform fast-mapping word acquisition using a proposed multimodal external memory architecture. Much work exists that shows that neural models are capable of following instructions whose meaning persists across episodes (i.e., slow-learning), however much less attention has been paid to instruction-following in a one-shot learning context. Using a simulated 3D navigation/manipulation domain, the paper shows that the proposed multimodal memory network is capable of both slow and one-shot word learning when trained via standard RL.

The submission was reviewed by four knowledgable referees, who read the author feedback and engaged in discussion with the authors. The paper is topical---one-shot language learning for instruction-following using neural models is of significant interest of-late. The reviewers agree that the proposed multimodal memory architecture is both interesting and technically solid. The reviewers raised concerns about the experimental evaluation and the role of embodiment. The author feedback together with discussion with reviewers were helpful in resolving some of these issues. However, the authors are encouraged to ensure that the paper clearly motivates the importance of embodiment to slow learning and fast-mapping, particularly given the large body of work in language acquisition in robotics, a truly embodied domain, which is notably missing from the related work discussion.

1,"This paper considers the problem of (biological) sequence design and optimization. The authors made an interesting yet important case that in certain sequence design tasks, a simple evolutionary greedy algorithm could be competitive with the increasingly complex contemporary black-box optimization models.

Most reviewers appreciate the design of the open-source simulation environment in benchmarking AdaLead (and other competing algorithms) in a number of biological sequence design tasks (e.g. TF binding, RNA, and protein). However, there is a common concern that the experimental results are not fine-grained enough to explain the outperforming results of the proposed algorithm. There are also unresolved comments on missing important BO baselines in the empirical study. As a purely empirical work, these appear to be important concerns. While these results appear to be useful for the domain of biological sequence design, the reviewers are unconvinced that the proposed algorithm is significantly novel, or the results are sufficiently compelling to merit an acceptance to this venue.

2,"This paper presents non-trivial and novel theoretical and computational modeling that accounts for experimentally observed phenomena: the theta phase procession and precession.

5,"This paper studies a timely problem and consider an interesting approach, but overall there were many concerns about technical details and the validity of the framework. The positive reviewer also mentioned concerns about the experiments, which others also found to be an insular comparison with weak baselines. Following the response period, in discussion there are additional concerns arising related to the lack of details, for instance related to possible unidentifiability of the model. As one reviewer discusses,  the authors are attempting to use RNNs to impute missing infection status labels when the missingness mechanism is assumed to be (i) not at random, (ii) playing out over time (as it is unclear whether Y^t is assumed (conditionally) independent of Y^t' with t' << t), and (iii) subject to interference (whether someone is tested is the 'treatment' here since it's a missingess problem and one person's propensity to be tested could causally affect another person's downstream infection status since apparently no Markov independence is assumed.

6,"The paper addresses the problem of domain generalization for learning spatio-temporal dynamics. It proposes a solution where an encoder captures some characteristics of a given environment, and a forecaster autoregressively predicts future dynamics conditioned on the characteristics learned by the encoder. Said otherwise, the forecaster learns the general form of dynamics parameterized by an environment representation extracted by the encoder. The conditioning is implemented via an adaptive instance normalization mechanism. A form of padding is also introduced in order to take into account boundary conditions. The two components encoder and forecaster are trained sequentially. This approach is casted in a meta-learning framework. Theoretical results inspired by multi-task learning and domain adaptation are also demonstrated. The model is evaluated and compared to different baselines on three problems, and for two different settings: varying initial conditions with a given dynamics, and dynamics with varying parameters.

This is a borderline paper. It targets a timely and important problem of domain generalization for dynamic environments. The proposed solution is original and compares well experimentally to several baselines. It allows for better generalization performance for the two test settings considered. In the current version, the paper however suffers from different weaknesses. First there is the imprecision of the arguments and the description of the experiments. Some of the arguments and claims are vague and sometimes abusive, not backed up by evidence. For example, a central claim is that the encoder learns time invariant quantities characterizing the environment when the learned representations indeed change with a time shift in the input for any environment. The same goes for the argument developed for the padding construction. It is claimed to model boundary conditions, but this is not supported by any theoretical or empirical evidence.
As noted by the reviewers, the theoretical analysis is disconnected from the algorithmic and experimental developments and does not bring much additional value to the paper. What is more embarrassing is that some of the claims in this section are overstated and induce incorrect conclusions.  From Theorem 3.1 and proposition 3.3, the authors suggest that multitask learning leads to better generalization than learning independently, while this is not formally guaranteed by the results (this is acknowledged by the authors in a later comment). Besides, the conditions of validity are not discussed while they seem to only cover situations for which the train and the test distributions are the same. The same holds for the second theoretical results (theorem 3.4). It is claimed that this result supports the authors’ idea of training encoder and forecaster sequentially, while it does not. Besides, the bounds in this result cannot be controlled as noted by the reviewers and are not useful in practice.

Overall, the paper addresses an important topic and proposes new solutions. The results are promising and it is indeed an interesting contribution. However, inaccuracies and incorrect or exaggerated claims make it difficult to accept the current version of the article. The article would make a strong and innovative contribution if it were written as a purely experimental article with a detailed description of the experiments and comparisons.

While I think this paper has something to contribute (and the empirical results suggest the method may outperform competitors), I think it would be improved by a rewrite (and possibly a restructure) that makes the part that is your contribution much more clear. For example, in the abstract, it's only in the sentence ""We show both theoretically
and empirically that potential vanishing/exploding gradients problems can be mitigated by enforcing orthogonality to the shared filter bases"" that we actually get to the part that is really novel about this contribution (the ""enforcing orthogonality""): that would ideally be much earlier in the abstract.

24,"The paper considers a collaborative decision-making setting in which one agent can suggest actions for a listening agent to execute. The listening agent is not bound to take these suggested actions. The paper models the listening agent's decision-making process as a POMDP, treating the suggestions provided by other agents as observations (i.e., dependent only on the state) that are used to update the belief state. The paper describes two representations of the suggested actions and presents empirical results on simulated domains that demonstrate that the listening agent's performance improves when following the suggestions of a perfect oracle, while it degrades given imperfect suggestions in proportion to the level of noise.

The paper was reviewed by three researchers who read the author response and discussed the paper together with the AC. The reviewers largely agree that the collaborative decision-making problem as formulated is interesting. The reviewers find that the idea of formulating suggestion-following as a POMDP with suggestions modeled as observations is clever, and that the description of the proposed formulation is clear and easy to follow. The two formulations of the observation function are reasonable, albeit very simple initial models, though the paper does not provide much insight into when one should be used over the other. A primary concern with the paper is that it only provides empirical results. The work would have significantly benefited from theoretical results, which would help to understand how the method would generalize to other domains.

",The paper looks at the problem of designing a framework to support collaboration between an autonomous system and a human supervisor. The human supervisor provides action suggestions to the autonomous agent to help overcome any limitations the human could have in its sensor capabilities.

25,"This paper had mixed reviews. 

One very positive expert reviewer (8) pointed out this paper used a rigorous approach to showing than FP8 can outperform INT8 in inference, which I agree is very interesting and useful.

 Another reviewer gave borderline acceptance (5), and I did not find any remaining concerns following the authors' response.

One reviewer gave borderline reject (4), but I did not find any remaining coherent major concerns following the authors' rebuttal. Also, this reviewer seemed less experienced, so I down-weighted this reviewer's score. 

Another reviewer gave borderline reject (4) with the following remaining concerns:

(1) ""I think this scheme does not show advantages over the existing work. ""
But I don't think this is true, since as far as I know previous work did not show such an advantage of FP over INT.

(2) ""The practical application of the algorithm in this paper will bring extra overhead. ""
I agree the authors should give more details here (especially for flexible), but at least for the flex bias method, the extra overhead seems quite reasonable (as this is similar to the standard method used for INT), so I'm not sure what is the issue.  

(3) ""it is a very intuitive view that we should adopt a format with more exponent bits on the data with a large distribution range"". 
But the authors' response correctly said this is not true (as a uniform distribution would be better represented using INT, no matter what it's range), and is not what they are saying. 

Therefore, I think the reviewer had some errors in understanding here, and so I down-weighted this reviewer's score.

27,"There is a clear consensus to accept this manuscript.  The results are impressive, and have a nice theoretical orientation that will allow the results to have continued impact as the field advances.  There are some minor errors by the authors in the discussions, which are worth the authors being aware of before submitting their final version.  In particular, they state that:

""The authors of [2,3] considered a bounded activation function in the infinite-width limit with large depth, in which case their variance

 always converged to a finite fixed point when depth is large [2, eq. 3]. Their chaotic and ordered phases are then defined by the behaviour of the correlation fixed point [2, eq. 5], which in turn determines the behaviour of the gradient [2, eq. 16].

In our case, shaping the activation leads to an unbounded function, and consequently the variance 
V
ℓ
α
α
 is not always bounded - even if we take the same limit as [2] (but shaping depends on depth instead like the DKS/TAT papers), in which case we get an ODE with finite time explosion. Intuitively, if we drop the Brownian motion from eq. 18 and consider

31,"Dear authors,

Your proposition of adding a noise scaling with the diagonal of the gradient covariance to the updates as a middle-ground between the identity and the full covariance is interesting and tackles the timely question of the links between optimization and generalization.

However, the reviewers had concerns about the experiments that did not reveal to which extent each trick had an influence.
I would like to add that, even though the term Fisher is used for both the true Fisher and tne empirical one, these two matrices encore very different kind of information. In particular, the latter is only defined when there is a dataset. Hence, your case study  (section 3.2) which uses the true Fisher does not apply to the empirical Fisher.

I encourage the authors to pursue in this direction but to update the experimental section in order to highlight the impact of each technique used.

","This paper proposes the method which improves the generalization performance of large-batch SGD by adding the diagonal Fisher matrix noise. In the theoretical analysis, it is shown that gradient descent with the diagonal noise is faster than it with the full-matrix noise on positive-quadratic problems. This paper proposes to add noise sampled from diagonal ""empirical"" Fisher matrix to the large batch gradient. The proposed method is shown empirically to achieve both comparable generalization and the training speedup.",0.1558441558441558,0.796850323677063,0.7486463189125061,0.7719965577125549,CORRECT,0.8570796847343445
32,"This work proposes algorithms for solving ERM with continuous losses satisfying the PL condition. The first algorithm achieves that by using a chainging noise variance and thus the paper frames the contribution in terms of the advantages of non-constant noise rate.

The problem is a well-studied one and the result is a nice if relatively modest improvement over Wang et al. However, as pointed out in reviews, in the context of convex optimization the same rate has already been established (Feldman,Koren,Talwar STOC 2020). This work is cited and briefly discussed but the discussion only includes one of the algorithms in the paper (that does have an additional log N factor). The overall assumptions in this paper are not comparable (weaker in some ways and stronger since they only require PL instead of strong convexity) but still the overall the contribution appears to be incremental.

","Private gradient descent is an important mechanism for private convex optimization. Excess risk upper bound is probably quite loose, so improving that may not necessarily improve actual excess risk. log(N) improvement may be an artifact of the analysis, and not an inherent advantage of dynamic schedules.

33,"This paper considers the task of training policies for human-robot collaborative tasks and observes the need for out of distribution generalisation for human policies as a pre-requisite for training. The authors present an approach for learning a latent representation for human policies that may be adapted online. 

Reviewers consider the motivation compelling and highly relevant for assistive robotics applications. In particular, reviewers consider the idea of learning a latent space for human policies as elegant. Further, thorough comparisons with related efforts strengthen the paper’s arguments. 

The primary weakness of the paper is that the tasks used to evaluate the approach are relatively simple (reaching and itch scratching). This raises the question of whether and to what extent the method can scale to more realistic tasks. Any experiments to suggest that the approach can bridge the sim2real gap have been suggested since the current results are purely in simulation. A better technical exposition of the test time adaptation has also been suggested. 

During the rebuttal phase,  the authors provided additional clarification/results for key reviewer questions such as mechanism for generalisation, overfitting, choice/training of encoders and their inclusion strengthens the overall paper. The major quantitative evaluation is on moderately complex tasks (e.g., itch scratching) supplemented by a user study. The user study is conducted in lab scenario (not with real users) and the setup bears resemblance to human studies in other human-collaborative domains (such as driving, collaborative assembly etc.). 

Overall, the paper contributes an approach for learning latent representations from interaction data that can be adapted online based on distribution shifts observed online. The manuscript can be strengthened by a clearer exposition on the mechanism/nature of generalisation attained, mechanisms for preventing overfitting and and an analysis of potential scalability to complex scenarios. Further, since the learning problem is scoped towards the specific domain of assistive tasks (as opposed to general robot tasks), a clearer setup of the problem context and a statement on the scalability of the results to end-users may also be considered by the authors. 


",This paper tackles the problem of generalizing to out-of-distribution human behavior when using sim2real methods. The authors propose the Prediction-based Assistive Latent eMbedding (PALM) framework. The PALM framework learns an encoder that maps a history onto a latent code that is the policy is conditioned upon. Experiments show that PALM policies lead to good performance on test human policies on an assistive reacher and assistive itch scratching task.,0.12048192771084339,0.8218426704406738,0.737513542175293,0.777397871017456,INCORRECT,0.931981086730957
34,"The paper gives high probability bounds on excess risk for differentially private learning algorithms, in the setting where the loss is assumed to be Lipschitz, smooth, and assumed to satisfy the Polyak-Łojasiewicz (PL) condition. The key idea in the paper is to leverage the curvature in the loss (PL condition) and the generalized Bernstein condition. 

Authors show that they get sharper bounds of the order \sqrt{p}/(n\epsilon) when the loss is assumed to satisfy the PL condition besides being convex Lipschitz/smooth. Without using some curvature information about the loss function, the best upper bounds we can get are in the order of \sqrt{p}/(n\epsilon) + 1/\sqrt{n} — and this is tight at least in terms of the dependence on n given the nearly matching lower bounds — in fact, the dependence on n is tight as it matches the non-private settings.  

So, I find it a bit misleading when authors say that they improve over the existing results. That statement is not true in its generality — it is true that we can leverage the PL condition to give faster rates but that is not the setting of prior work. Again, the bounds that authors compare against are for smooth/Lipschitz convex loss functions and without any assumption on the curvature of the loss. 

If we do look at the literature for when and/or how can curvature help, we can compare against the existing bounds for strongly convex losses. The best-known result in the setting that is most closely related is that of Feldman et al. (STOC 2020): https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3357713.3384335. As we can check from Theorem 4.9 in that paper, the bounds we get are in the order of 1/n + d/n^2 which is actually better — not surprising since PL condition is a weaker condition. There is merit to the results in this paper but the current narrative is quite misleading and a more careful comparison with the existing literature is needed. The bounds are hard to parse — for example, what is the dependence on the strong convexity parameter (\mu)? It would also help to instantiate specific loss functions so that we can fix some of the parameters in the bound to have a clear comparison with the existing bounds.

","The paper gives a high probability excess population risk bound for differentially private optimization algorithm under $G$-Lipschitz, $L$-smooth and PL condition with gradient perturbation.

Experiments: There is some disagreement among reviewers on the adequacy of the experiments, with at least two reviewers calling for experiments involving 'natural photos'. I believe the author's responses adequately address these concerns: they pointed out that the key selling point of their paper is the ability to model structured noise which is less relevant in natural photos.

One aspect that is not convincing in the experiments is the budgets being exponentially distributed: having a strong concentration around a mean (with something like a Gaussian tail), or a power-law distribution, would be more suitable.

","A paper proposes a customisation strategy named ""Split-Max"" for federated learning. Split-Max can adjust the model size according to the devices' budget while maintaining good accuracy and robustness. The proposed approach can train both accurate and robust models in a joint fashion, where all but batch-norm layers are shared for efficiency. It's not perfectly clear how the split and aggregation are done in the proposed approach.

41,"All four reviewers enjoyed this paper and were particularly impressed by the videos provided in the supplementary material. The results are very impressive indeed. The reviewers also agreed that using a multi stage approach was interesting and effective. The two new datasets were deemed useful to the generation community and the proposed metrics and human evaluations were appreciated by the reviewers. A few smaller concerns included a missing failure analysis and some clarifications questions which were addressed in the rebuttal. Given the above, I recommend acceptance.

","The paper discusses a method for generating long videos in which new content is introduced as the camera moves forwards. It has been shown that training at high res both in space and time is prohibitively expensive.

42,"The reviewers were generally split on this paper. On the one hand, reviewers generally appreciated the clear presentation, discussion, and explanations, and the experiments. On the other hand, most reviewers commented on the lack of comparative evaluation to other works, including works that are related conceptually. While the authors have a potentially reasonable argument for omitting such comparisons, in the balance I do not believe that the reviewers were actually convinced by this. Particularly when the novelty of the contribution is not crystal clear, such comparisons are important, so I am inclined to not recommend acceptance at this point (though I acknowledge that the paper is clear borderline and could be accepted).

","The idea of pruning is to improve the performance of neural networks. The idea is to give the network more freedom to make decisions. This could lead to a more efficient network that is more efficient at finding new connections. This is a new way of thinking about neural networks and how they are trained. It could also lead to more efficient networks that can be used to find new connections in the network.

43,"All reviewers agree that the author's response has addressed their primary concerns. Reviewer frMM had two reservations that resulted in a borderline rating 1) concerns about how the adversarial samples were generated and 2) a request for evaluation on AntMaze. The author's followup response and further experiments address 1 and partially 2. It would be great to see RORL results on AntMaze in the final version.

Overall, the performance of RORL is competitive with state-of-the-art methods on Mujoco and Adroit tasks with fewer ensemble elements needed. The main benefit is on improved performance against adversarial attack, where RORL significantly improves over existing methods. I think the paper makes a nice contribution that the community will find valuable.

I encourage the authors to think carefully about how to integrate the additional experiments into the paper to resolve the questions raised by reviewers.




","The paper investigates the problem of training robust RL agents with offline datasets. It claims that regularizing policy and value networks to have similar values against adversarial perturbations can achieve state-of-the-art performance.

44,"Three out of four reviewers are positive about the paper after the author response and during the discussion.

Strengths include
* The proposed method for parameter reduction in transformers allows end-2-end learning cross-modal representations especially on long videos, which has not been possible before
* Good performance on audio and video understanding
* Extensive set of ablations

Concerns include a somewhat incremental nature of the paper and the still large computational resources to run the experiments.

","The authors present a method for learning audiovisual (AV) representations from videos using a Transformer-based model architecture. The AV representations are learned by training the network to solve two self-supervised pertaining tasks. The proposed model indeed has some merits (e.g., parameter sharing and negative sampling).

45,"This paper proposes a method for inspecting and interpreting the visual representations learned by self-supervised methods. 
The method is conceptually simple and intuititive, the authors assume that concept labels for the images are available, and then go on to learn a mapping between the learned image vectors and the human-provided descriptions of the images. The key insight is to learn a reverse mapping, i.e., to map label vectors to representation vectors. Specifically, feature vectors are quantized using k-means to obtain clusters;  images are labeled (automatically) with a diverse set of concepts from expert models trained with supervision on
external data sources, and  a linear model is trained  to map concepts to clusters, measuring the mutual information between the representation and human-interpretable concepts.

Reviewers raised some questions regarding the relation of the approach to topic models, the difference between reverse probing and linear probing, implementation details and computation. The authors addressed reviewers comments convincingly with additional experiments and/or explanations.

","The paper aims to measure the interpretability of the visual representations learned by the recent self-supervised models. It proposes reverse linear probing, a post-hoc method that aims at predicting a quantized version of the internal representation from semantic label.

The mutual information is approximated by the proposed Quantized Reverse Probing.",0.2297872340425532,0.8588544130325317,0.7881810665130615,0.8220015168190002,INCORRECT,0.9648633599281311
46,"The reviews are generally positive (though somewhat short), and a large pre-training corpus for legal text will likely be useful for NLP research. One reviewer gave a reject score (5) with the following two weaknesses:

A) The dataset comes from a wide spectrum of law-related data sources, which may differ substantially and hence limit the usefulness of the dataset.

B) Privacy


I am not too worried about Point A because large language models seem to be able to learn from diverse data sources.

Regarding Point B, the separate ethics review mentions the privacy concerns as well but finds that the submission sufficiently discusses this concern and sees no serious ethical issues.

Hence overall I recommend accepting the paper.


",The paper compiles a dataset from various sources into one unified format for use in downstream research. This dataset can be used for pre-training and can provide useful insights into various social issues and data-related insights. The accompanying PoL-BERT language models do not seem to be trained optimally and their usefulness may be limited.

47,"The paper presents a new problem: open-set single domain generalization, where only one source domain is available and unknown classes and unseen target domains increase the difficulty of the task. To tackle this challenging problem, this paper designs a CrossMatch approach to improve the performance of SDG methods on identifying unknown classes by leveraging a multi-binary classifier. CrossMatch generates auxiliary samples out of source label space by using an adversarial data augmentation strategy. Then, the paper proposes a cross-classifier consistency regularization that minimizes the multi-binary classifier's output and one-vs-all multi-class classifier's output. 

The proposed OS-SDG is an interesting and realistic problem. However, since it is way more challenging, the optimal solution to it remains elusive. Some reviewers think the method might be heuristic and lack theoretical guarantees. Nevertheless, the results are promising and the paper makes a first step toward the challenging OS-SDG problem. Another concern is that the CCR loss needs more ablation studies to further analyze its role. Though the authors have added more explanation of this part, I suggest the authors put more ablation studies in the final supplementary document. 

Overall, the paper is novel and interesting.  I would recommend acceptance of this paper given its novelty and impressive performance, but I highly suggest the authors add more ablation studies in the final supplementary, as suggested by the reviewers.

49,"This paper tackles the problem of feature interactions identification in black-box models, which is an important problem towards achieving explainable AI/ML. The authors formulate the problem under the multi-armed bandit setting and propose a solution based on the UCB algorithm. This simplification of the problem leads to a computationally feasible solution, for which the authors provide several theoretical analyses. The importance of the learned interactions is showcased in a new deep learning model leveraging these interactions, leading to a reduction in model size (thereby competing against pruning methods) as well as an improvement in accuracy (thereby competing against generalization methods). Although the proposed approach essentially builds on the specific UCB algorithm, it could likely be extended/modified to other (potentially more efficient) bandit strategies. A drawback of this work resides in the experiments being entirely synthetics. In order to close the gap with practice, experiments on real datasets of higher dimensionality should be conducted.
",The authors propose two key ideas. The first is using the UCB algorithm to identify strong feature interactions in a computationally efficient way. The second is that of using the identified pairwise interactions to build a lightweight GAM-like model that they call ParaACE. The paper can be improved upon by addressing some of the aspects but even in its current state it will be of interest to the larger AI/ML community. It is shown that the proposed method improves accuracy by 26% and reduces the model size by 100+ times.,0.1847389558232932,0.7970960736274719,0.7735105156898499,0.7851262092590332,CORRECT,0.8038074970245361
