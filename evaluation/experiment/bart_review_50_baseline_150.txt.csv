0,"The paper investigates the capacity for neural language models to perform fast-mapping word acquisition using a proposed multimodal external memory architecture. Much work exists that shows that neural models are capable of following instructions whose meaning persists across episodes (i.e., slow-learning), however much less attention has been paid to instruction-following in a one-shot learning context. Using a simulated 3D navigation/manipulation domain, the paper shows that the proposed multimodal memory network is capable of both slow and one-shot word learning when trained via standard RL.

The submission was reviewed by four knowledgable referees, who read the author feedback and engaged in discussion with the authors. The paper is topical---one-shot language learning for instruction-following using neural models is of significant interest of-late. The reviewers agree that the proposed multimodal memory architecture is both interesting and technically solid. The reviewers raised concerns about the experimental evaluation and the role of embodiment. The author feedback together with discussion with reviewers were helpful in resolving some of these issues. However, the authors are encouraged to ensure that the paper clearly motivates the importance of embodiment to slow learning and fast-mapping, particularly given the large body of work in language acquisition in robotics, a truly embodied domain, which is notably missing from the related work discussion.

","The paper presents an argument for a multi-modal memory-architecture called DCEM whose key/queries and values are dependent on language and vision modalities. The proposed DCEM model outperforms baselines on various metrics and ablation. The paper only investigates generalization of object names. This is kind of a low hanging fruit for generalization in language space. The experiments on nonsense words are randomly generated characters in every episode of training and evaluation, to tease out that the new word is being memorized and associated, not that the agent is memorizing that ""dax"" per episode changes meaning.

It could be a single sentence maybe but not a whole subsection.",0.14942528735632185,0.7699291706085205,0.7542904615402222,0.7620295882225037,INCORRECT,0.5837467908859253
1,"This paper considers the problem of (biological) sequence design and optimization. The authors made an interesting yet important case that in certain sequence design tasks, a simple evolutionary greedy algorithm could be competitive with the increasingly complex contemporary black-box optimization models.

Most reviewers appreciate the design of the open-source simulation environment in benchmarking AdaLead (and other competing algorithms) in a number of biological sequence design tasks (e.g. TF binding, RNA, and protein). However, there is a common concern that the experimental results are not fine-grained enough to explain the outperforming results of the proposed algorithm. There are also unresolved comments on missing important BO baselines in the empirical study. As a purely empirical work, these appear to be important concerns. While these results appear to be useful for the domain of biological sequence design, the reviewers are unconvinced that the proposed algorithm is significantly novel, or the results are sufficiently compelling to merit an acceptance to this venue.


","Simple evolutionary algorithm ""AdaLead"" outperformed several existing methods. There is a lack of exploration to understand why AdaLead is outperforming. Some of the figure labels can be improved. There are some acronyms likely not familiar to computer scientists with little biological background left unexplained, such as ""w.t."" in fig 1B. The paper is clearly written. It is unclear to me the ML significance of this work to the ICLR community. It might be more suitable for a specific compbio venue. What could we learn from this result?

2,"This paper presents non-trivial and novel theoretical and computational modeling that accounts for experimentally observed phenomena: the theta phase procession and precession. These phenomena are implicated in the neural representation and learning of neuronal networks involving hippocampus. Although the current manuscript does not address the learning and the presentations are limited to a linear track environment, it represents a clear advance in linking spatial and temporal information representations by extending the standard continuous attractor models that do not exhibit phase procession/precession. Furthermore, the model elegantly explains the biologically observed unimodal and bimodal cells. The authors are encouraged to improve the clarity of some parts of the writing.


","The proposed model is based on a network of recurrent connections with a Gaussian profile. The model is intended to be used in a variety of ways, not just as an example of how to use a neural network. It is not clear if the model can be applied to other areas of the brain, such as the development of new neurons, or if it can be generalized to other parts of the body. The main challenge is that the model does not provide a way of predicting how the brain will react to a change in the environment. It would be helpful to have a better idea of what is going on in the brain when a change is made, rather than relying on the model to predict it. The best way to understand the model is to look at the way the brain responds to changes in its environment, and to try and predict them.",0.16541353383458648,0.7611321210861206,0.7586920261383057,0.7599101066589355,CORRECT,0.9966914653778076

This leads to better outputs for medical imaging, image to labels task, and horse to zebra and vice versa. The paper is lacking in technical details: what is the patch-size used for RGB-histogram?

The commonly mentioned strengths:
- there is a big need in the community for this type of work

- some feedback about the experiments done on the datasets -> this point comes back consistently among all reviewers, in terms of the amount, settings and reproducibility.. The authors are adviced to address this in future work, to keep momentum for the use of the community on this dataset 
- there was some discussion about tensorflow and pytorch, but based on the discussion both seem supported
- some settings / image types could be better supported

5,"This paper studies a timely problem and consider an interesting approach, but overall there were many concerns about technical details and the validity of the framework. The positive reviewer also mentioned concerns about the experiments, which others also found to be an insular comparison with weak baselines. Following the response period, in discussion there are additional concerns arising related to the lack of details, for instance related to possible unidentifiability of the model. As one reviewer discusses,  the authors are attempting to use RNNs to impute missing infection status labels when the missingness mechanism is assumed to be (i) not at random, (ii) playing out over time (as it is unclear whether Y^t is assumed (conditionally) independent of Y^t' with t' << t), and (iii) subject to interference (whether someone is tested is the 'treatment' here since it's a missingess problem and one person's propensity to be tested could causally affect another person's downstream infection status since apparently no Markov independence is assumed. There is also consensus that the writing quality can be greatly improved. Overall this work contains some ideas with potential in a thorough revision 

","The proposed approach formalizes an intuitive understanding of the spread of an infectious disease in (as far as I am aware) a novel way. Experimental results on a (private) real-world dataset are somewhat mixed, but show that MIINT achieves a better true positive rate at an acceptable false positive rate. It is not clear to me of the practical significance of the “isolation policy” results. Even using an oracle, Figure 1 seems to suggest that between 30-40% of the population would need to be tested to see a reduction in the infection rate. Neither the paper nor the supplement describe the features available in the real data. It seems a bit strange that the AUROC and AUPRC in Table 1 are almost perfectly negatively correlated. Is there any explanation for that?",0.1419753086419753,0.7661690711975098,0.7489691972732544,0.75747150182724,INCORRECT,0.9155428409576416
6,"The paper addresses the problem of domain generalization for learning spatio-temporal dynamics. It proposes a solution where an encoder captures some characteristics of a given environment, and a forecaster autoregressively predicts future dynamics conditioned on the characteristics learned by the encoder. Said otherwise, the forecaster learns the general form of dynamics parameterized by an environment representation extracted by the encoder. The conditioning is implemented via an adaptive instance normalization mechanism. A form of padding is also introduced in order to take into account boundary conditions. The two components encoder and forecaster are trained sequentially. This approach is casted in a meta-learning framework. Theoretical results inspired by multi-task learning and domain adaptation are also demonstrated. The model is evaluated and compared to different baselines on three problems, and for two different settings: varying initial conditions with a given dynamics, and dynamics with varying parameters.

This is a borderline paper. It targets a timely and important problem of domain generalization for dynamic environments. The proposed solution is original and compares well experimentally to several baselines. It allows for better generalization performance for the two test settings considered. In the current version, the paper however suffers from different weaknesses. First there is the imprecision of the arguments and the description of the experiments. Some of the arguments and claims are vague and sometimes abusive, not backed up by evidence. For example, a central claim is that the encoder learns time invariant quantities characterizing the environment when the learned representations indeed change with a time shift in the input for any environment. The same goes for the argument developed for the padding construction. It is claimed to model boundary conditions, but this is not supported by any theoretical or empirical evidence.
As noted by the reviewers, the theoretical analysis is disconnected from the algorithmic and experimental developments and does not bring much additional value to the paper. What is more embarrassing is that some of the claims in this section are overstated and induce incorrect conclusions.  From Theorem 3.1 and proposition 3.3, the authors suggest that multitask learning leads to better generalization than learning independently, while this is not formally guaranteed by the results (this is acknowledged by the authors in a later comment). Besides, the conditions of validity are not discussed while they seem to only cover situations for which the train and the test distributions are the same. The same holds for the second theoretical results (theorem 3.4). It is claimed that this result supports the authors’ idea of training encoder and forecaster sequentially, while it does not. Besides, the bounds in this result cannot be controlled as noted by the reviewers and are not useful in practice.

Overall, the paper addresses an important topic and proposes new solutions. The results are promising and it is indeed an interesting contribution. However, inaccuracies and incorrect or exaggerated claims make it difficult to accept the current version of the article. The article would make a strong and innovative contribution if it were written as a purely experimental article with a detailed description of the experiments and comparisons.

","This work tackles the task of forecasting dynamics in different domains simultaneously. Using an encoder which is trained to determine the task, the inferred latent vector is then used to adapt a forecasting network to the task at hand.

The contribution is not groundbreaking but should be significant enough to warrant acceptance. It would be nice to see how the model deals with other families of dynamics.

Besides, a simple yet effective few-shot untargeted backdoor attack is proposed and achieves significant effectiveness in both digital and physical-world scenarios. This paper reveals the vulnerability of VOT to backdoor attacks caused by outsourced training or using third-party pre-trained models.

The authors clarified in their response that indeed VAE in Vedantam et al (2017) is similar, but it has been used for image synthesis and not classification/GZSL. (2) Empirical evaluations and setup are not convincing (R2) and not clear -- R3 has provided a very detailed review and a follow up discussion raising several important concerns such as (i) absence of a validation set to test generalization, (ii) the hyperparameters set up; (iii) not clear advantages of learning a joint model as opposed to unidirectional mappings (R1 also supports this claim).

19,"The paper develops a theoretical framework (in the context of learning theory) for training overparameterized networks with label noise, and shows that, in the context of ensemble distillation, teacher networks need not be good classifiers as long as they are good conditional samplers (in the sense defined in the paper).

The reviewers are positive about the theoretical aspects of the paper, describing them as interesting and technically sound, but are less convinced about the practicality of the theory or the significance of the empirical results.

21,"I agree with the concerns raised by the reviewers. In particular, the issues of novelty and experimental evaluation (mentioned in the revision summary) remain the major weak points of the paper. My impression is that the changes made in the revision represent a significant experimental addition to the paper, one which might merit a full pass through peer review, and one which in any event did not alter the reviewers' scores. While I think this paper has something to contribute (and the empirical results suggest the method may outperform competitors), I think it would be improved by a rewrite (and possibly a restructure) that makes the part that is your contribution much more clear. For example, in the abstract, it's only in the sentence ""We show both theoretically
and empirically that potential vanishing/exploding gradients problems can be mitigated by enforcing orthogonality to the shared filter bases"" that we actually get to the part that is really novel about this contribution (the ""enforcing orthogonality""): that would ideally be much earlier in the abstract.

","The method reduces 10.01M parameters of ResNet-34 with almost the same error rate.

23,"The paper makes a novel contribution to methods for generating novel molecules from scratch. The core idea is to generate a shape that fits the molecular pocket without looking at the protein structure.

Two out of three reviewers recommended acceptance. Reviewers emphasize that the method is innovative and interesting, and the empirical performance appealing (especially given that only the shape information is provided to the model). Strong performance is enabled by good design choices made across the paper, such as including the pretraining stage.

The reviewer that recommend rejection raised issues related to the novelty and clarity of the paper. However, I believe the paper is sufficiently clear and novel to meet the bar for acceptance.

Overall, it is my pleasure to recommend acceptance of the paper.

","This paper proposes a zero-shot drug design method based on sketch. Using only information about the shape of the protein pocket avoids some of the limitations of the data set and binding simulations. However, the model is limited by ignoring the different interaction forces (hydrogen bonding, π-Stacking, etc.) that occur when molecules bind to proteins. The connecting step based entirely on greedy algorithms may lead to unreasonable results. The model is still similar to the transformer-based sequence generation model used in machine translation tasks. The tree-like structure is less expressive for molecules with complex structures.

24,"The paper considers a collaborative decision-making setting in which one agent can suggest actions for a listening agent to execute. The listening agent is not bound to take these suggested actions. The paper models the listening agent's decision-making process as a POMDP, treating the suggestions provided by other agents as observations (i.e., dependent only on the state) that are used to update the belief state. The paper describes two representations of the suggested actions and presents empirical results on simulated domains that demonstrate that the listening agent's performance improves when following the suggestions of a perfect oracle, while it degrades given imperfect suggestions in proportion to the level of noise.

The paper was reviewed by three researchers who read the author response and discussed the paper together with the AC. The reviewers largely agree that the collaborative decision-making problem as formulated is interesting. The reviewers find that the idea of formulating suggestion-following as a POMDP with suggestions modeled as observations is clever, and that the description of the proposed formulation is clear and easy to follow. The two formulations of the observation function are reasonable, albeit very simple initial models, though the paper does not provide much insight into when one should be used over the other. A primary concern with the paper is that it only provides empirical results. The work would have significantly benefited from theoretical results, which would help to understand how the method would generalize to other domains.

","The paper looks at the problem of designing a framework to support collaboration between an autonomous system and a human supervisor. Simulated experiments on a discrete state problem with an offline generated policy show some improvement using suggestions from a human with an omniscient view. The core idea seems to be a useful one, although the demonstration here is on small, discrete, 2-agent environments without catastrophic failures, brittle behavior, or clear inconsistencies. This work seems theoretical enough to not have significant societal impacts (beyond, perhaps, the use of computational agents, but here they have human supervisors!)

25,"This paper had mixed reviews. 

One very positive expert reviewer (8) pointed out this paper used a rigorous approach to showing than FP8 can outperform INT8 in inference, which I agree is very interesting and useful.

 Another reviewer gave borderline acceptance (5), and I did not find any remaining concerns following the authors' response.

One reviewer gave borderline reject (4), but I did not find any remaining coherent major concerns following the authors' rebuttal. Also, this reviewer seemed less experienced, so I down-weighted this reviewer's score. 

Another reviewer gave borderline reject (4) with the following remaining concerns:

(1) ""I think this scheme does not show advantages over the existing work. ""
But I don't think this is true, since as far as I know previous work did not show such an advantage of FP over INT.

(2) ""The practical application of the algorithm in this paper will bring extra overhead. ""
I agree the authors should give more details here (especially for flexible), but at least for the flex bias method, the extra overhead seems quite reasonable (as this is similar to the standard method used for INT), so I'm not sure what is the issue.  

(3) ""it is a very intuitive view that we should adopt a format with more exponent bits on the data with a large distribution range"". 
But the authors' response correctly said this is not true (as a uniform distribution would be better represented using INT, no matter what it's range), and is not what they are saying. 

Therefore, I think the reviewer had some errors in understanding here, and so I down-weighted this reviewer's score.

The results are impressive, and have a nice theoretical orientation that will allow the results to have continued impact as the field advances.  There are some minor errors by the authors in the discussions, which are worth the authors being aware of before submitting their final version.  In particular, they state that:

""The authors of [2,3] considered a bounded activation function in the infinite-width limit with large depth, in which case their variance

 always converged to a finite fixed point when depth is large [2, eq. 3]. Their chaotic and ordered phases are then defined by the behaviour of the correlation fixed point [2, eq. 5], which in turn determines the behaviour of the gradient [2, eq. 16].

In our case, shaping the activation leads to an unbounded function, and consequently the variance 
V
ℓ
α
α
 is not always bounded - even if we take the same limit as [2] (but shaping depends on depth instead like the DKS/TAT papers), in which case we get an ODE with finite time explosion. Intuitively, if we drop the Brownian motion from eq. 18 and consider

31,"Dear authors,

Your proposition of adding a noise scaling with the diagonal of the gradient covariance to the updates as a middle-ground between the identity and the full covariance is interesting and tackles the timely question of the links between optimization and generalization.

However, the reviewers had concerns about the experiments that did not reveal to which extent each trick had an influence.
I would like to add that, even though the term Fisher is used for both the true Fisher and tne empirical one, these two matrices encore very different kind of information. In particular, the latter is only defined when there is a dataset. Hence, your case study  (section 3.2) which uses the true Fisher does not apply to the empirical Fisher.

I encourage the authors to pursue in this direction but to update the experimental section in order to highlight the impact of each technique used.

","The method is shown empirically to achieve both comparable generalization and the training speedup compared to small batch. The intuition of using diagonal fisher for faster convergence in generalization performance is still missing from my perspective. The experiments are conducted on MNIST and CIFAR10 and 100, which I feel is a bit insufficient for a paper that deals with generalization gaps in large batches. There is a typo in the next line of Eq. (2) in which the notation ""l_i"" is not defined at this time. In addition, the notation ‘l’ is not clearly defined in the paper.

32,"This work proposes algorithms for solving ERM with continuous losses satisfying the PL condition. The first algorithm achieves that by using a chainging noise variance and thus the paper frames the contribution in terms of the advantages of non-constant noise rate.

The problem is a well-studied one and the result is a nice if relatively modest improvement over Wang et al. However, as pointed out in reviews, in the context of convex optimization the same rate has already been established (Feldman,Koren,Talwar STOC 2020). This work is cited and briefly discussed but the discussion only includes one of the algorithms in the paper (that does have an additional log N factor). The overall assumptions in this paper are not comparable (weaker in some ways and stronger since they only require PL instead of strong convexity) but still the overall the contribution appears to be incremental.

33,"This paper considers the task of training policies for human-robot collaborative tasks and observes the need for out of distribution generalisation for human policies as a pre-requisite for training. The authors present an approach for learning a latent representation for human policies that may be adapted online. 

Reviewers consider the motivation compelling and highly relevant for assistive robotics applications. In particular, reviewers consider the idea of learning a latent space for human policies as elegant. Further, thorough comparisons with related efforts strengthen the paper’s arguments. 

The primary weakness of the paper is that the tasks used to evaluate the approach are relatively simple (reaching and itch scratching). This raises the question of whether and to what extent the method can scale to more realistic tasks. Any experiments to suggest that the approach can bridge the sim2real gap have been suggested since the current results are purely in simulation. A better technical exposition of the test time adaptation has also been suggested. 

During the rebuttal phase,  the authors provided additional clarification/results for key reviewer questions such as mechanism for generalisation, overfitting, choice/training of encoders and their inclusion strengthens the overall paper. The major quantitative evaluation is on moderately complex tasks (e.g., itch scratching) supplemented by a user study. The user study is conducted in lab scenario (not with real users) and the setup bears resemblance to human studies in other human-collaborative domains (such as driving, collaborative assembly etc.). 

Overall, the paper contributes an approach for learning latent representations from interaction data that can be adapted online based on distribution shifts observed online. The manuscript can be strengthened by a clearer exposition on the mechanism/nature of generalisation attained, mechanisms for preventing overfitting and and an analysis of potential scalability to complex scenarios. Further, since the learning problem is scoped towards the specific domain of assistive tasks (as opposed to general robot tasks), a clearer setup of the problem context and a statement on the scalability of the results to end-users may also be considered by the authors. 


","This paper tackles the problem of generalizing to out-of-distribution human behavior when using sim2real methods to develop assistive robotics capabilities. The authors propose the Prediction-based Assistive Latent eMbedding (PALM) framework, which involves learning a latent space by predicting future human actions from a history of observations and actions.

34,"The paper gives high probability bounds on excess risk for differentially private learning algorithms, in the setting where the loss is assumed to be Lipschitz, smooth, and assumed to satisfy the Polyak-Łojasiewicz (PL) condition. The key idea in the paper is to leverage the curvature in the loss (PL condition) and the generalized Bernstein condition. 

Authors show that they get sharper bounds of the order \sqrt{p}/(n\epsilon) when the loss is assumed to satisfy the PL condition besides being convex Lipschitz/smooth. Without using some curvature information about the loss function, the best upper bounds we can get are in the order of \sqrt{p}/(n\epsilon) + 1/\sqrt{n} — and this is tight at least in terms of the dependence on n given the nearly matching lower bounds — in fact, the dependence on n is tight as it matches the non-private settings.  

So, I find it a bit misleading when authors say that they improve over the existing results. That statement is not true in its generality — it is true that we can leverage the PL condition to give faster rates but that is not the setting of prior work. Again, the bounds that authors compare against are for smooth/Lipschitz convex loss functions and without any assumption on the curvature of the loss. 

If we do look at the literature for when and/or how can curvature help, we can compare against the existing bounds for strongly convex losses. The best-known result in the setting that is most closely related is that of Feldman et al. (STOC 2020): https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3357713.3384335. As we can check from Theorem 4.9 in that paper, the bounds we get are in the order of 1/n + d/n^2 which is actually better — not surprising since PL condition is a weaker condition. There is merit to the results in this paper but the current narrative is quite misleading and a more careful comparison with the existing literature is needed. The bounds are hard to parse — for example, what is the dependence on the strong convexity parameter (\mu)? It would also help to instantiate specific loss functions so that we can fix some of the parameters in the bound to have a clear comparison with the existing bounds.

38,"Summary of discussion: Three reviewers rated the paper Good (7) while Reviewer2 disagreed. R2's criticism was focussed on how this work is placed within existing/related literature, and no technical problem was identified. The authors have addressed some of R2's comments/concerns, R2 has not participated in the discussion.

Novelty and contributions: Overall the reviews seem consistent with an incremental paper which is technically valid, improves the state of the art on a reasonably difficult task. However, it does not appear from the reviews that the paper substantially advances our understanding of machine learning more broadly beyond this specific application.

Experiments: There is some disagreement among reviewers on the adequacy of the experiments, with at least two reviewers calling for experiments involving 'natural photos'. I believe the author's responses adequately address these concerns: they pointed out that the key selling point of their paper is the ability to model structured noise which is less relevant in natural photos.

On the balance of things, I think this paper should be accepted, but I wouldn't argue if it did not make the cut due to its narrow scope. For this reason, I recommended poster presentation.

","A paper proposed a new method for blind image denoising using a ""GAN2GAN"" network. Different from previous work noise2noise, the proposed method only needs single noisy images to train the network, without noisy pairs. The idea of refining the noisy image iteratively is reasonable, which makes the image content for training progressively better. The experiments were done with extensive datasets and baselines. The motivation of using the proposed network design is not clear. Using more generators will lead to larger capacity models than existing methods. More analyses are needed in Sec. 4.4 for ablation study. If the authors can provide comparisons or discussion, analysis on these algorithms and comparison, it would be helpful. It is notclear whether the performance gains are due to use such largercapacity models.

39,"This paper proposes a federated learning (FL) scheme that is suitable for clients/devices with heterogeneous resources. The scheme Split-Mix trains multiple models of different sizes and adversarial-robustness levels, which are tailored to the budgets of the individual device. Empirical results show encouraging results.

It is clear that FL will have to work with clients with diverse resources, a point that is appreciated. Indeed, it is anticipated that widely-dispersed inference will have to deal with a highly-heterogeneous mix of clients. The study is quite thorough. One aspect that is not convincing in the experiments is the budgets being exponentially distributed: having a strong concentration around a mean (with something like a Gaussian tail), or a power-law distribution, would be more suitable.

","Split-Max can adjust the model size according to the devices' budget while maintaining good accuracy and robustness. With customisation, the models are smaller and more robust under budget constraints. The idea of BN layer-wise mixing is kind of confusing. The reason of sharing all parameters except the batch-normalisation requires further elaboration. The assumption about the computational resources of clients would be better clarified. The evaluation results are heavily based on the assumption of exponentially distributed budgets. There is a large number of typos (mainly after Section 4).

Overall, the performance of RORL is competitive with state-of-the-art methods on Mujoco and Adroit tasks with fewer ensemble elements needed.

45,"This paper proposes a method for inspecting and interpreting the visual representations learned by self-supervised methods. 
The method is conceptually simple and intuititive, the authors assume that concept labels for the images are available, and then go on to learn a mapping between the learned image vectors and the human-provided descriptions of the images. The key insight is to learn a reverse mapping, i.e., to map label vectors to representation vectors. Specifically, feature vectors are quantized using k-means to obtain clusters;  images are labeled (automatically) with a diverse set of concepts from expert models trained with supervision on
external data sources, and  a linear model is trained  to map concepts to clusters, measuring the mutual information between the representation and human-interpretable concepts.

Reviewers raised some questions regarding the relation of the approach to topic models, the difference between reverse probing and linear probing, implementation details and computation. The authors addressed reviewers comments convincingly with additional experiments and/or explanations.

","The paper aims to measure the interpretability of the visual representations learned by the recent self-supervised models. It proposes reverse linear probing, a post-hoc method that aims at predicting a quantized version of the internal representation (as observed in specific examples) from semantic label.

To tackle this challenging problem, this paper designs a CrossMatch approach to improve the performance of SDG methods on identifying unknown classes by leveraging a multi-binary classifier. CrossMatch generates auxiliary samples out of source label space by using an adversarial data augmentation strategy. Then, the paper proposes a cross-classifier consistency regularization that minimizes the multi-binary classifier's output and one-vs-all multi-class classifier's output. 

The proposed OS-SDG is an interesting and realistic problem. However, since it is way more challenging, the optimal solution to it remains elusive.

49,"This paper tackles the problem of feature interactions identification in black-box models, which is an important problem towards achieving explainable AI/ML. The authors formulate the problem under the multi-armed bandit setting and propose a solution based on the UCB algorithm. This simplification of the problem leads to a computationally feasible solution, for which the authors provide several theoretical analyses. The importance of the learned interactions is showcased in a new deep learning model leveraging these interactions, leading to a reduction in model size (thereby competing against pruning methods) as well as an improvement in accuracy (thereby competing against generalization methods). Although the proposed approach essentially builds on the specific UCB algorithm, it could likely be extended/modified to other (potentially more efficient) bandit strategies. A drawback of this work resides in the experiments being entirely synthetics. In order to close the gap with practice, experiments on real datasets of higher dimensionality should be conducted.

They demonstrate that Para ACE offers strong gains in model compression compared to other competing approaches, and often improves performance relative to its overparameterized teacher model.
